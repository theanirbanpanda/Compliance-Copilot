The COVID -19 related credit for qualified sick and 
family leave wages is limited to leave taken after 
March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021, and may 
no longer be claimed on Form 941, Form 943, or 
Form 944. Generally, the credit for qualified sick and fam-
ily leave wages, as enacted under the Families First Coro-
navirus Response Act (FFCRA) and amended and exten-
ded by the COVID -related T ax Relief Act of 2020, for leave 
taken after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2021, and 
the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages under 
sections 3131, 3132, and 3133 of the Internal Revenue 
Code, as enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act of 
2021 (the ARP), for leave taken after March 31, 2021, and 
before October 1, 2021, have expired. However, employ-
ers that pay qualified sick and family leave wages in 2024 
or 2025 for leave taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021, are eligible to claim a credit for qualified 
sick and family leave wages in 2024 or 2025. Effective for 
tax periods beginning after December 31, 2023, the lines 
used to claim the credit for qualified sick and family leave 
wages have been removed from Form 941, Employer’s 
QUARTERL Y Federal T ax Return; Form 943, Employer’s 
Annual T ax Return for Agricultural Employees; and Form 
944, Employer’s ANNUAL Federal T ax Return; because it 
would be extremely rare for an employer to pay wages af-
ter December 31, 2023, for qualified sick and family leave 
taken after March 31, 2020, and before October 1, 2021. 
Instead, if you’re eligible to claim the credit for qualified 
sick and family leave wages because you paid the wages 
in 2024 or 2025 for an earlier applicable leave period, file 
Form 941 -X, after filing Form 941, Form 943 -X, or Form 
944- X to claim the credit for qualified sick and family leave 
wages paid in 2024 or 2025. Filing a Form 941 -X, Form 
943- X, or Form 944 -X before filing a Form 941 for the 
quarter, or Form 943 or Form 944 for the year, may result 
in errors or delays in processing your Form 941 -X, Form 
943-X, or Form 944-X.
Form 941 (sp), Form 943 (sp), and Form 944 (sp).  If 
you prefer your form and instructions in Spanish, you can 
file Form 941 (sp), Form 943 (sp), or Form 944 (sp).
Qualified small business payroll tax credit for in-
creasing research activities.  For tax years beginning 
before January 1, 2023, a qualified small business may 
elect to claim up to $250,000 of its credit for increasing re-
search activities as a payroll tax credit. The Inflation Re-
duction Act of 2022 (the IRA) increases the election 
amount to $500,000 for tax years beginning after Decem-
ber 31, 2022. The payroll tax credit election must be made 
on or before the due date of the originally filed income tax 
return (including extensions). The portion of the credit 
used against payroll taxes is allowed in the first calendar 
quarter beginning after the date that the qualified small 
business filed its income tax return. The election and de-
termination of the credit amount that will be used against 
the employer’s payroll taxes are made on Form 6765, 
Credit for Increasing Research Activities. The amount 
from Form 6765 must then be reported on Form 8974, 
Qualified Small Business Payroll T ax Credit for Increasing 
Research Activities.
Starting in the first quarter of 2023, the payroll tax credit 
is first used to reduce the employer share of social secur-
ity tax up to $250,000 per quarter and any remaining 
credit reduces the employer share of Medicare tax for the 
quarter. Any remaining credit, after reducing the employer 
share of social security tax and the employer share of 
Medicare tax, is then carried forward to the next quarter. 
Form 8974 is used to determine the amount of the credit 
that can be used in the current quarter. The amount from 
Form 8974, line 12, or, if applicable, line 17, is reported on 
Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944. For more information 
about the payroll tax credit, see IRS.gov/
ResearchPayrollTC . Also see the line 16 instructions in the 
Instructions for Form 941 (line 17 instructions in the In-
structions for Form 943 or line 13 instructions in the In-
structions for Form 944) for information on reducing your 
record of tax liability for this credit.

Disaster tax relief.  Disaster tax relief is available for 
those impacted by disasters. For more information about 
disaster relief, go to IRS.gov/DisasterT axRelief .
Payroll tax credit for certain tax -exempt organiza-
tions affected by qualified disasters.  Section 303(d) of 
the T axpayer Certainty and Disaster T ax Relief Act of 2020 
allows for a payroll tax credit for certain tax -exempt organi-
zations affected by certain qualified disasters not related 
to COVID -19. This credit is claimed on Form 5884 -D (not 
on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944). Form 5884 -D is 
filed after the Form 941 for the quarter, Form 943 for the 
year, or Form 944 for the year for which the credit is being 
claimed has been filed. For more information about this 
credit, go to IRS.gov/Form5884D .
2025 withholding tables.  The Percentage Method and 
Wage Bracket Method withholding tables, the employer in-
structions on how to figure employee withholding, and the 
amount to add to a nonresident alien employee's wages 
for figuring income tax withholding are included in Pub. 
15-T , Federal Income T ax Withholding Methods, available 
at IRS.gov/Pub15T .
Moving expense reimbursement.  P .L. 115 -97 sus-
pends the exclusion for qualified moving expense reim-
bursements from your employee's income for tax years 
beginning after 2017 and before 2026. However, the ex-
clusion is still available in the case of a member of the U.S. 
Armed Forces on active duty who moves because of a 
permanent change of station due to a military order. The 
exclusion applies only to reimbursement of moving expen-
ses that the member could deduct if they had paid or in-
curred them without reimbursement. See Moving Expen-
ses in Pub. 3, Armed Forces' T ax Guide, for the definition 
of what constitutes a permanent change of station and to 
learn which moving expenses are deductible.
Withholding on supplemental wages.  P .L. 115-97 low-
ered the withholding rates on supplemental wages for tax 
years beginning after 2017 and before 2026. See section 
7 for the withholding rates.
Backup withholding.  P .L. 115 -97 lowered the backup 
withholding rate to 24% for tax years beginning after 2017 
and before 2026. For more information on backup with-
holding, see Backup withholding , later.
Certification program for professional employer or-
ganizations (PEOs). The Stephen Beck, Jr., Achieving a 
Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act of 2014 required the 
IRS to establish a voluntary certification program for 
PEOs. PEOs handle various payroll administration and tax 
reporting responsibilities for their business clients and are 
typically paid a fee based on payroll costs. T o become and 
remain certified under the certification program, certified 
professional employer organizations (CPEOs) must meet 
various requirements described in sections 3511 and 
7705 and related published guidance. Certification as a 
CPEO may affect the employment tax liabilities of both the 
CPEO and its customers. A CPEO is generally treated for 
employment tax purposes as the employer of any individ-
ual who performs services for a customer of the CPEO 
and is covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)
(2) between the CPEO and the customer (CPEO con-
tract), but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. T o become a CPEO, the or-
ganization must apply through the IRS Online Registration 
System. For more information or to apply to become a 
CPEO, go to IRS.gov/CPEO . Also see Revenue Proce-
dure 2023 -18, 2023 -13 I.R.B. 605, available at 
IRS.gov/irb/2023-13_IRB#REV-PROC-2023-18 .
Outsourcing payroll duties.  Generally, as an employer, 
you’re responsible to ensure that tax returns are filed and 
deposits and payments are made, even if you contract 
with a third party to perform these acts. Y ou remain re-
sponsible if the third party fails to perform any required ac-
tion. Before you choose to outsource any of your payroll 
and related tax duties (that is, withholding, reporting, and 
paying over social security, Medicare, FUTA, and income 
taxes) to a third -party payer, such as a payroll service pro-
vider or reporting agent, go to IRS.gov/
OutsourcingPayrollDuties  for helpful information on this 
topic. If a CPEO pays wages and other compensation to 
an individual performing services for you, and the services 
are covered by a CPEO contract, then the CPEO is gener-
ally treated as the employer, but only for wages and other 
compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. How-
ever, with respect to certain employees covered by a 
CPEO contract, you may also be treated as an employer 
of the employees and, consequently, may also be liable for 
federal employment taxes imposed on wages and other 
compensation paid by the CPEO to such employees. For 
more information on the different types of third -party payer 
arrangements, see section 16 .

No federal income tax withholding on disability pay-
ments for injuries incurred as a direct result of a ter-
rorist attack directed against the United States.  Disa-
bility payments for injuries incurred as a direct result of a 
terrorist attack directed against the United States (or its al-
lies) aren't included in income. Because federal income 
tax withholding is only required when a payment is includi-
ble in income, no federal income tax should be withheld 
from these payments. See Pub. 907, T ax Highlights for 
Persons With Disabilities; and Pub. 3920, T ax Relief for 
Victims of T errorist Attacks.
Voluntary withholding on dividends and other distri-
butions by an Alaska Native Corporation (ANC).  A

Definition of marriage.  A marriage of two individuals is 
recognized for federal tax purposes if the marriage is rec-
ognized by the state or territory of the United States in 
which the marriage is entered into, regardless of legal resi-
dence. T wo individuals who enter into a relationship that is 
denominated as marriage under the laws of a foreign juris-
diction or an American Indian tribe are recognized as mar-
ried for federal tax purposes if the relationship would be recognized as marriage under the laws of at least one 
state or territory of the United States, regardless of legal 
residence. Individuals who have entered into a registered 
domestic partnership, civil union, or other similar relation-
ship that isn't denominated as a marriage under the law of 
the state or territory of the United States where such rela-
tionship was entered into aren't lawfully married for federal 
tax purposes, regardless of legal residence.

withholding, and FUTA tax.
You must receive written notice from the IRS to file 
Form 944.  If you’ve been filing quarterly Forms 941 and 
believe your employment taxes for the calendar year will 
be $1,000 or less, and you would like to file an annual 
Form 944 instead of quarterly Forms 941, you must con-
tact the IRS during the first calendar quarter of the tax 
year to request to file Form 944. Y ou must receive written 
notice from the IRS to file Form 944 instead of quarterly 
Forms 941 before you may file this form. For more infor-
mation on requesting to file Form 944, including the meth-
ods and deadlines for making a request, see the Instruc-
tions for Form 944.
Employers can request to file quarterly Forms 941 in-
stead of an annual Form 944.  If you received notice 
from the IRS to file Form 944 but would like to file quarterly 
Forms 941 instead, you must contact the IRS during the 
first calendar quarter of the tax year to request to file quar-
terly Forms 941. Y ou must receive written notice from the 
IRS to file quarterly Forms 941 instead of Form 944 before 
you may file these forms. For more information on request-
ing to file quarterly Forms 941, including the methods and

discover an error on a previously filed Form 941, make the 
correction using Form 941 -X. If you discover an error on a 
previously filed Form 943, make the correction using Form 
943- X. If you discover an error on a previously filed Form 
944, make the correction using Form 944 -X. Form 941 -X, 
Form 943 -X, and Form 944 -X are filed separately from 
Form 941, Form 943, and Form 944. Form 941 -X, Form 
943- X, and Form 944 -X are used by employers to claim 
refunds or abatements of employment taxes, rather than 
Form 843. See section 13  for more information.
Zero wage return.  If you haven't filed a “final” Form 940 
and "final" Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944, or aren't a 
“seasonal” employer (Form 941 only), you must continue 
to file a Form 940 and Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944,

Federal tax deposits must be made by electronic 
funds transfer (EFT).  Y ou must use EFT to make all fed-
eral tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made using the 
Electronic Federal T ax Payment System (EFTPS). If you

professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other 
trusted third party to make electronic deposits on your be-
half. Also, you may arrange for your financial institution to 
initiate a same- day wire payment on your behalf. EFTPS is 
a free service provided by the Department of the T reasury. 
Services provided by your tax professional, financial insti-
tution, payroll service, or other third party may have a fee.

Hiring New Employees
Eligibility for employment.  Y ou must verify that each 
new employee is legally eligible to work in the United 
States, including American Samoa, Guam, the CNMI, the 
U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), and Puerto Rico. This includes 
completing the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
(USCIS) Form I -9, Employment Eligibility Verification. Y ou 
can get Form I -9 at USCIS.gov/Forms . For more informa-
tion, go to the USCIS website at USCIS.gov/I-9-Central , or 
call 800-375-5283 or 800-767-1833 (TTY).
Y ou may use the Social Security Number Verification 
Service (SSNVS) at SSA.gov/employer/ssnv.htm  to verify 
that an employee name matches an SSN. A person may 
have a valid SSN but not be authorized to work in the Uni-
ted States. Y ou may use E -Verify at E-Verify.gov  to confirm 
the employment eligibility of newly hired employees.
New hire reporting. All 50 states, and most of the territo-
ries, have a new hire registry. Y ou’re required to report any 
new employee to a designated state new hire registry. A 
new employee is an employee who hasn't previously been 
employed by you or was previously employed by you but 
has been separated from such prior employment for at 
least 60 consecutive days.
Many states accept a copy of Form W -4 with employer 
information added. Go to the Office of Child Support En-
forcement website at acf.hhs.gov/programs/css/employers 
for more information. Employers in American Samoa, 
Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto Rico should con-
tact their local government for information on their new 
hire registry.
W-4 request.  Ask each new employee to complete the 
2025 Form W-4. See section 9 .
Name and social security number (SSN).  Record 
each new employee's name and SSN from their social se-
curity card if it is available. If an employee can't provide 
their social security card, you should verify their SSN and their eligibility for employment as discussed under Verifi-
cation of SSNs  in section 4. Any employee without a so-
cial security card should apply for one. See section 4 .
Information Returns
Y ou must file Forms W -2 to report wages paid to 
employees. Y ou may also be required to file information 
returns to report certain types of payments made during 
the year. For example, you must file Form 1099 -NEC, 
Nonemployee Compensation, to report payments of $600 
or more to persons not treated as employees (for 
example, independent contractors) for services performed 
for your trade or business. For details about filing Forms 
1099 and for information about required electronic filing, 
see the General Instructions for Certain Information 
Returns for general information, and the separate, specific 
instructions for each information return you file (for 
example, the Instructions for Forms 1099 -MISC and 
1099- NEC). Generally, don't use Forms 1099 to report 
wages and other compensation you paid to employees; 
report these on Form W -2. See the General Instructions 
for Forms W -2 and W -3 for details about filing Form W -2 
and for information about required electronic filing.
Technical Services Operation (TSO).  The IRS oper-
ates the TSO to answer questions about reporting on 
Forms W-2, W- 3, and 1099, and other information returns. 
If you have questions related to reporting on information 
returns, call 866 -455- 7438 (toll free) or 304 -263- 8700 (toll 
call). The center can also be reached by email at

bers (TINs) or attachments in email because email isn't 
secure.
Federal Income Tax 
Withholding
References to federal income tax withholding 
don't apply to employers in American Samoa, 
Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto Rico, un-
less you have employees who are subject to U.S. income 
tax withholding. Contact your local tax department for in-
formation about income tax withholding.
Withhold federal income tax from each wage payment 
or supplemental unemployment compensation plan 
benefit payment according to the employee's Form W -4 
and the correct withholding table in Pub. 15 -T . Farm 
operators and crew leaders must withhold federal income 
tax from the wages of farmworkers if the wages are 
subject to social security and Medicare taxes. If you're 
paying supplemental wages to an employee, see section 
7. If you have nonresident alien employees, see 
Withholding federal income taxes on the wages of 
nonresident alien employees  in section 9.

(including distributions from tax -favored retirement plans), 
annuities, and individual retirement arrangements (IRAs).
Nonpayroll Income Tax 
Withholding
Nonpayroll federal income tax withholding (reported on 
Forms 1099 and Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings) 
must be reported on Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld 
Federal Income T ax. Separate deposits are required for 
payroll (Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944) and nonpayroll 
(Form 945) withholding. Nonpayroll items include the 
following.
•Pensions (including distributions from tax-favored 
retirement plans, for example, section 401(k), section 
403(b), and governmental section 457(b) plans), 
annuities, and IRA distributions.
•Military retirement.
•Gambling winnings.
•Indian gaming profits.
•Certain government payments on which the recipient 
elected voluntary income tax withholding.
•Dividends and other distributions by an ANC on which 
the recipient elected voluntary income tax withholding.•Payments subject to backup withholding.
For details on depositing and reporting nonpayroll 
income tax withholding, see the Instructions for Form 945.
Distributions from nonqualified pension plans and 
deferred compensation plans.  Because distributions to 
participants from some nonqualified pension plans and 
deferred compensation plans (including section 457(b) 
plans of tax -exempt organizations) are treated as wages 
and are reported on Form W -2, income tax withheld must 
be reported on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944, not on 
Form 945. However, distributions from such plans to a 
beneficiary or estate of a deceased employee aren't wa-
ges and are reported on Forms 1099 -R, Distributions 
From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit -Sharing 
Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc.; income tax with-
held must be reported on Form 945.
Backup withholding.  Y ou must generally withhold 24% 
of certain taxable payments if the payee fails to furnish you 
with their correct TIN. This withholding is referred to as 
“backup withholding.”
Payments subject to backup withholding include inter-
est, dividends, patronage dividends, rents, royalties, com-
missions, nonemployee compensation, payments made in 
settlement of payment card or third -party network transac-
tions, and certain other payments you make in the course 
of your trade or business. In addition, transactions by 
brokers and barter exchanges and certain payments 
made by fishing boat operators are subject to backup 
withholding.Employer Responsibilities
The following list provides a brief summary of your basic responsibilities. Because the individual circumstances for each employer 
can vary greatly, responsibilities for withholding, depositing, and reporting employment taxes can differ. Each item in this list has a

that the number furnished is correct, or when payees must 
certify that they’re not subject to backup withholding or are 
exempt from backup withholding. The Instructions for the 
Requester of Form W -9 include a list of types of payees 
who are exempt from backup withholding. For more infor-
mation, see Pub. 1281, Backup Withholding for Missing 
and Incorrect Name/TIN(s).

Generally, your filing address for Form 940, Form 941, 
Form 943, Form 944, Form 945, or Form CT-1 depends on 
the location of your residence or principal place of 
business and whether or not you’re including a payment 
with your return. There are separate filing addresses for 
these returns if you’re a tax -exempt organization or 
government entity. See the separate instructions for Form 
940, Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, Form 945, or Form

a financial institution is subject to a penalty. The penalty is 
$25 or 2% of the payment, whichever is more. However, 
the penalty on dishonored payments of $24.99 or less is 
an amount equal to the payment. For example, a 
dishonored payment of $18 is charged a penalty of $18.

Calendar
The following is a list of important dates and 
responsibilities. The dates listed here haven’t been 
adjusted for Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays (see 
the TIP next). Pub. 509, T ax Calendars (for use in 2025), 
adjusts the dates for Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays. See section 11  for information about depositing 
taxes reported on Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, and 
Form 945. See section 14  for information about depositing 
FUTA tax. Due dates for forms required for health 
coverage reporting aren't listed here. For these dates, see 
Pub. 509.
If any date shown next for filing a return, furnishing 
a form, or depositing taxes falls on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is the next 
business day. The term "legal holiday" means any legal 
holiday in the District of Columbia. A statewide legal holi-
day delays a filing due date only if the IRS office where 
you’re required to file is located in that state. However, a 
statewide legal holiday doesn't delay the due date of fed-
eral tax deposits. See Deposits Due on Business Days 
Only  in section 11. For any filing due date, you’ll meet the 
“file” or “furnish” requirement if the envelope containing 
the return or form is properly addressed, contains suffi-
cient postage, and is postmarked by the U.S. Postal

Introduction
This publication explains your tax responsibilities as an 
employer, including agricultural employers and employers 
whose principal place of business is in American Samoa, 
Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, or Puerto Rico. It explains the 
requirements for withholding, depositing, reporting, pay-
ing, and correcting employment taxes. It explains the 
forms you must give to your employees, those your em-
ployees must give to you, and those you must send to the 
IRS and the SSA. References to “income tax” in this guide 
apply only to federal income tax. Contact your state or lo-
cal tax department to determine their rules. Whenever the 
term "United States" is used in this publication, it includes 
American Samoa, Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto 
Rico, unless otherwise noted.
When you pay your employees, you don't pay them all 
the money they earned. As their employer, you have the 
added responsibility of withholding taxes from their pay-
checks. The federal income tax and employees' share of 
social security and Medicare taxes that you withhold from 
your employees' paychecks are part of their wages that you pay to the U.S. T reasury instead of to your employees. 
Y our employees trust that you pay the withheld taxes to 
the U.S. T reasury by making federal tax deposits. This is 
the reason that these withheld taxes are called trust fund 
taxes. If federal income, social security, or Medicare taxes 
that must be withheld aren't withheld or aren't deposited or 
paid to the U.S. T reasury, the trust fund recovery penalty 
may apply. See section 11  for more information.
This publication also provides employers, including em-
ployers in the USVI and Puerto Rico, with a summary of 
their responsibilities in connection with the tax under the 
Federal Unemployment T ax Act, known as FUTA tax. See 
section 14  for more information.
Additional employment tax information is available in 
Pubs. 15 -A, 15 -B, and 15 -T . Pub. 15 -A includes special-
ized information supplementing the basic employment tax 
information provided in this publication. Pub. 15 -B, Em-
ployer's T ax Guide to Fringe Benefits, contains information 
about the employment tax treatment and valuation of vari-
ous types of noncash compensation. Pub. 15 -T includes 
the federal income tax withholding tables and instructions 
on how to use the tables.
Most employers must withhold (except FUTA), deposit, 
report, and pay the following employment taxes.
•Income tax.
•Social security tax.
•Medicare tax.
•FUTA tax.
There are exceptions to these requirements. See sec-
tion 15  for guidance. Railroad retirement taxes are ex-
plained in the Instructions for Form CT-1.

government employers are generally subject to federal in-
come tax withholding but not FUTA tax. Most elected and 
appointed public officials of state or local governments are 
employees under common -law rules. See chapter 3 of 
Pub. 963, Federal -State Reference Guide. In addition, wa-
ges, with certain exceptions, are subject to social security 
and Medicare taxes. See section 15  for more information

  1635 1. Employer Identification 
Number (EIN)
If you’re required to report employment taxes or give tax 
statements to employees or annuitants, you need an EIN.
The EIN is a nine -digit number the IRS issues. The dig-
its are arranged as follows: 00 -0000000. It is used to iden-
tify the tax accounts of employers and certain others who 
have no employees. Use your EIN on all of the items you 
send to the IRS and the SSA. For more information, see 
Pub. 1635.
If you don’t have an EIN, you may apply for one online 
by going to IRS.gov/EIN . Y ou may also apply for an EIN by 
faxing or mailing Form SS -4 to the IRS. If the principal 
business was created or organized outside of the United 
States or U.S. territories, you may also apply for an EIN by 
calling 267-941- 1099 (toll call). Don't use an SSN in place 
of an EIN.
Y ou should have only one EIN. If you have more than 
one and aren't sure which one to use, call 800 -829-4933 
or 800 -829- 4059 (TDD/TTY for persons who are deaf, 
hard of hearing, or have a speech disability). Give the 
numbers you have, the name and address to which each 
was assigned, and the address of your main place of busi-
ness. The IRS will tell you which number to use. For more 
information, see Pub. 1635.
If you took over another employer's business (see Suc-
cessor employer  in section 9), don't use that employer's 
EIN. If you’ve applied for an EIN but don't have your EIN 
by the time a return is due, file a paper return and enter 
“Applied For” and the date you applied for it in the space 
shown for the number.
Always be sure the EIN on the form you file ex-
actly matches the EIN the IRS assigned to your 
business. Don't use your SSN or individual tax-
payer identification number (ITIN) on forms that ask for an 
EIN. If you used an EIN (including a prior owner's EIN) on 
Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944 that is different from the 
EIN reported on Form W -3, see Box h —Other EIN used 
this year  in the General Instructions for Forms W -2 and 
W-3. On Form W -3 (PR) for Puerto Rico, “Other EIN used 
this year” is reported in box f. The name and EIN on Form 
945 must match the name and EIN on your information re-
turns where federal income tax withholding is reported (for 
example, backup withholding reported on Form 
1099- NEC). Filing a Form 945 with an incorrect EIN or us-
ing another business's EIN may result in penalties and de-
lays in processing your return.
Agricultural employers that have crew leaders.  An 
agricultural employer must record the crew leader's name, 
address, and EIN. See sections 2 and 14.

2. Who Are Employees?
Generally, employees are defined either under common 
law or under statutes for certain situations. See Pub. 15 -A 
for details on statutory employees and nonemployees.
Employee status under common law.  Generally, a 
worker who performs services for you is your employee if 
you have the right to control what will be done and how it 
will be done. This is so even when you give the employee 
freedom of action. What matters is that you have the right 
to control the details of how the services are performed. 
See Pub. 15 -A for more information on how to determine 
whether an individual providing services is an independ-
ent contractor or an employee.
Generally, people in business for themselves aren't em-
ployees. For example, doctors, lawyers, veterinarians, and 
others in an independent trade in which they offer their 
services to the public are usually not employees. If the 
business is incorporated, corporate officers who work in 
the business are employees of the corporation.
If an employer -employee relationship exists, it doesn't 
matter what it is called. The employee may be called an 
agent or independent contractor. It also doesn't matter 
how payments are measured or paid, what they’re called, 
or if the employee works full or part time.
Statutory employees.  If someone who works for you 
isn't an employee under the common -law rules discussed 
earlier, don't withhold federal income tax from their pay, 
unless backup withholding applies. Although the following 
persons may not be common -law employees, they’re con-
sidered employees by statute for social security and Medi-
care tax purposes if the conditions under T ests , later, are 
met.
a. An agent or commission driver who delivers meat, veg-
etable, fruit, or bakery products; beverages (other than 
milk); laundry; or dry cleaning for someone else.
b. A full -time life insurance salesperson who sells primar-
ily for one company.
c. A homeworker who works at home or off premises by 
the guidelines of the person for whom the work is done, 
with materials or goods furnished by and returned to that 
person or to someone that person designates.
d. A traveling or city salesperson (other than an agent or 
commission driver) who works full time (except for sideline 
sales activities) for one firm or person getting orders from 
customers. The orders must be for merchandise for resale 
or supplies for use in the customer's business. The cus-
tomers must be retailers, wholesalers, contractors, or op-
erators of hotels, restaurants, or other businesses dealing 
with food or lodging.
Tests. Withhold social security and Medicare taxes 
from statutory employees' wages if all three of the follow-
ing tests apply.1.The service contract states or implies that almost all 
of the services are to be performed personally by 
them.
2.They have little or no investment in the equipment and 
property used to perform the services (other than an 
investment in transportation facilities).
3.The services are performed on a continuing basis for 
the same payer.
Persons in a or d, earlier, are also employees for FUTA 
tax purposes if tests 1 through 3 are met.
Pub. 15 -A gives examples of the employer -employee 
relationship.
Statutory nonemployees.  Direct sellers, qualified real 
estate agents, and certain companion sitters are, by law, 
considered nonemployees. They’re generally treated as 
self- employed for all federal tax purposes, including in-
come and employment taxes. See Pub. 15 -A for more in-
formation.
Farmworkers. In general, you're an employer of farm-
workers if your employees:
•Raise or harvest agricultural or horticultural products 
on your farm (including the raising and feeding of live-
stock);
•Work in connection with the operation, management, 
conservation, improvement, or maintenance of your 
farm and its tools and equipment, if the major part of 
such service is performed on a farm;
•Provide services relating to salvaging timber, or clear-
ing land of brush and other debris, left by a hurricane 
(also known as hurricane labor), if the major part of 
such service is performed on a farm;
•Handle, process, or package any agricultural or horti-
cultural commodity in its unmanufactured state if you 
produced over half of the commodity (for a group of up 
to 20 unincorporated operators, all of the commodity); 
or
•Do work for you related to cotton ginning, turpentine, 
gum resin products, or the operation and maintenance 
of irrigation facilities.
For this purpose, the term “farm” includes stock, dairy, 
poultry, fruit, fur -bearing animal, and truck farms, as well 
as plantations, ranches, nurseries, ranges, greenhouses 
or other similar structures used primarily for the raising of 
agricultural or horticultural commodities, and orchards.
Farmwork doesn't include reselling activities that don't 
involve any substantial activity of raising agricultural or 
horticultural commodities, such as a retail store or a 
greenhouse used primarily for display or storage. It also 
doesn’t include processing services that change a com-
modity from its raw or natural state, or services performed 
after a commodity has been changed from its raw or natu-
ral state.
Crew leaders.  If you're a crew leader, you're an em-
ployer of farmworkers. A crew leader is a person who fur-
nishes and pays (either on their own behalf or on behalf of 
Publication 15 (2025) 13

the farm operator) workers to do farmwork for the farm op-
erator. If there is no written agreement between you and 
the farm operator stating that you're their employee and if 
you pay the workers (either for yourself or for the farm op-
erator), then you're a crew leader. For FUTA tax rules, see 
section 14 .
If you're a crew leader, you're not considered the em-
ployee of the farm operator for services you perform in fur-
nishing farmworkers and as a member of the crew.
H-2A agricultural workers.  On Form W -2, don't 
check box 13 (Statutory employee), as H -2A workers 
aren't statutory employees.
Treating employees as nonemployees.  Y ou’ll gener-
ally be liable for social security and Medicare taxes and 
withheld income tax if you don't deduct and withhold these 
taxes because you treated an employee as a nonem-
ployee. Y ou may be able to figure your liability using spe-
cial section 3509 rates for the employee share of social 
security and Medicare taxes and federal income tax with-
holding. The applicable rates depend on whether you filed 
required Forms 1099. Y ou can't recover the employee 
share of social security tax, Medicare tax, or income tax 
withholding from the employee if the tax is paid under sec-
tion 3509. Y ou’re liable for the income tax withholding re-
gardless of whether the employee paid income tax on the 
wages. Y ou continue to owe the full employer share of so-
cial security and Medicare taxes. The employee remains 
liable for the employee share of social security and Medi-
care taxes. See section 3509 for details. Also see the In-
structions for Form 941- X, the Instructions for Form 943 -X, 
or the Instructions for Form 944-X.
Section 3509 rates aren't available if you intentionally 
disregard the requirement to withhold taxes from the em-
ployee or if you withheld income taxes but not social se-
curity or Medicare taxes. Section 3509 isn't available for 
reclassifying statutory employees. See Statutory employ-
ees, earlier in this section.
If the employer issued required information returns, the 
section 3509 rates are the following.
•For social security taxes: employer rate of 6.2% plus 
20% of the employee rate of 6.2%, for a total rate of 
7.44% of wages.
•For Medicare taxes: employer rate of 1.45% plus 20% 
of the employee rate of 1.45%, for a total rate of 1.74% 
of wages.
•For Additional Medicare T ax: 0.18% (20% of the em-
ployee rate of 0.9%) of wages subject to Additional 
Medicare T ax.
•For federal income tax withholding, the rate is 1.5% of 
wages.
If the employer didn't issue required information returns, 
the section 3509 rates are the following.
•For social security taxes: employer rate of 6.2% plus 
40% of the employee rate of 6.2%, for a total rate of 
8.68% of wages.•For Medicare taxes: employer rate of 1.45% plus 40% 
of the employee rate of 1.45%, for a total rate of 2.03% 
of wages.
•For Additional Medicare T ax: 0.36% (40% of the em-
ployee rate of 0.9%) of wages subject to Additional 
Medicare T ax.
•For federal income tax withholding, the rate is 3.0% of 
wages.
Relief provisions.  If you have a reasonable basis for 
not treating a worker as an employee, you may be relieved 
from having to pay employment taxes for that worker. T o 
get this relief, you must file all required federal tax returns, 
including information returns, on a basis consistent with 
your treatment of the worker. Y ou (or your predecessor) 
must not have treated any worker holding a substantially 
similar position as an employee for any periods beginning 
after 1977. See Pub. 1976, Do Y ou Qualify for Relief Un-
der Section 530.
IRS help.  If you want the IRS to determine whether a 
worker is an employee, file Form SS-8.
Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP). 
Employers who are currently treating their workers (or a 
class or group of workers) as independent contractors or 
other nonemployees and want to voluntarily reclassify 
their workers as employees for future tax periods may be 
eligible to participate in the VCSP if certain requirements 
are met. File Form 8952 to apply for the VCSP . For more 
information, go to IRS.gov/VCSP .
Business Owned and Operated by 
Spouses
If you and your spouse jointly own and operate a business 
and share in the profits and losses, you may be partners in 
a partnership, whether or not you have a formal partner-
ship agreement. See Pub. 541 for more details. The part-
nership is considered the employer of any employees, and 
is liable for any employment taxes due on wages paid to 
its employees.
Exception— Qualified joint venture.  For tax years be-
ginning after 2006, the Small Business and Work Opportu-
nity T ax Act of 2007 (P .L. 110 -28) provides that a “qualified 
joint venture,” whose only members are spouses filing a 
joint income tax return, can elect not to be treated as a 
partnership for federal tax purposes. A qualified joint ven-
ture conducts a trade or business where:
•The only members of the joint venture are spouses 
who file a joint income tax return,
•Both spouses materially participate (see Material par-
ticipation  in the instructions for Schedule C (Form 
1040), line G) in the trade or business (mere joint own-
ership of property isn't enough),
•Both spouses elect to not be treated as a partnership, 
and
14 Publication 15 (2025)

The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing.
•The business is co-owned by both spouses and isn't 
held in the name of a state law entity such as a part-
nership or limited liability company (LLC).
T o make the election, all items of income, gain, loss, 
deduction, and credit must be divided between the spou-
ses, in accordance with each spouse's interest in the ven-
ture, and reported as sole proprietors on a separate 
Schedule C (Form 1040) or Schedule F (Form 1040). 
Each spouse must also file a separate Schedule SE (Form 
1040) to pay self -employment taxes, as applicable. See 
the Instructions for Form 1040 -SS for American Samoa, 
Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto Rico.
Spouses using the qualified joint venture rules are trea-
ted as sole proprietors for federal tax purposes and gener-
ally don't need an EIN. If employment taxes are owed by 
the qualified joint venture, either spouse may report and 
pay the employment taxes due on the wages paid to the 
employees using the EIN of that spouse's sole proprietor-
ship. Generally, filing as a qualified joint venture won't in-
crease the spouses' total tax owed on the joint income tax 
return. However, it gives each spouse credit for social se-
curity earnings on which retirement benefits are based 
and for Medicare coverage without filing a partnership re-
turn.
Note.  If your spouse is your employee, not your partner, 
see One spouse employed by another  in section 3.
For more information on qualified joint ventures, go to 
IRS.gov/QJV .
Exception— Community income.  If you and your 
spouse wholly own an unincorporated business as com-
munity property under the community property laws of a 
state, foreign country, or U.S. territory, you can treat the 
business either as a sole proprietorship (of the spouse 
who carried on the business) or a partnership. Y ou may 
still make an election to be taxed as a qualified joint ven-
ture instead of a partnership. See Exception —Qualified 
joint venture , earlier in this section.
3. Family Employees
Child employed by parents.  Payments for the services 
of a child under age 18 who works for their parent in a 
trade or business aren't subject to social security and 
Medicare taxes if the trade or business is a sole proprie-
torship or a partnership in which each partner is a parent 
of the child. If these payments are for work other than in a 
trade or business, such as domestic work in the parent's 
private home, they’re not subject to social security and 
Medicare taxes until the child reaches age 21. However, 
see Covered services of a child or spouse , later. Pay-
ments for the services of a child under age 21 who works 
for their parent, whether or not in a trade or business, 
aren't subject to FUTA tax. Payments for the services of a 
child of any age who works for their parent are generally 
subject to income tax withholding unless the payments 
are for domestic work in the parent's home, or unless the 
payments are for work other than in a trade or business 
and are less than $50 in the quarter or the child isn't regu-
larly employed to do such work.One spouse employed by another.  The wages for the 
services of an individual who works for their spouse in a 
trade or business are subject to income tax withholding 
and social security and Medicare taxes, but not to FUTA 
tax. However, the payments for services of one spouse 
employed by another in other than a trade or business, 
such as domestic service in a private home, aren't subject 
to social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes.
Covered services of a child or spouse.  The wages for 
the services of a child or spouse are subject to income tax 
withholding as well as social security, Medicare, and FUTA 
taxes if they work for:
•A corporation, even if it is controlled by the child's pa-
rent or the individual's spouse;
•A partnership, even if the child's parent is a partner, 
unless each partner is a parent of the child;
•A partnership, even if the individual's spouse is a part-
ner; or
•An estate, even if it is the estate of a deceased parent.
In these situations, the child or spouse is considered to 
work for the corporation, partnership, or estate, not you.
Parent employed by their child.  When the employer is 
a child employing their parent, the following rules apply.
•Payments for the services of a parent in their child’s 
(the employer’s) trade or business are subject to in-
come tax withholding and social security and Medi-
care taxes.
•Payments for the services of a parent not in their 
child’s (the employer’s) trade or business are generally 
not subject to social security and Medicare taxes.
Social security and Medicare taxes do apply to 
payments made to a parent for domestic services 
if all of the following apply.
•The parent is employed by their child (the employer).
•The employer has a child or stepchild (including an 
adopted child) living in the home.
•The employer is a surviving spouse, divorced and not 
remarried, or living with a spouse who, because of a 
mental or physical condition, can't care for their child 
or stepchild for at least 4 continuous weeks in the cal-
endar quarter in which the service is performed.
•The child or stepchild of the employer is either under 
age 18 or, due to a mental or physical condition, re-
quires the personal care of an adult for at least 4 con-
tinuous weeks in the calendar quarter in which the 
service is performed.
Payments made to a parent employed by their child 
aren't subject to FUTA tax, regardless of the type of serv-
ices provided.

4. Employee's Social Security 
Number (SSN)
Y ou’re required to get each employee's name and SSN 
and to enter them on Form W -2. An employee's SSN con-
sists of nine digits arranged as follows: 000 -00-0000. This 
requirement also applies to resident and nonresident alien 
employees. Y ou should ask your employee to show you 
their social security card, but the employee isn't required 
to show the card if it isn't available. However, if an em-
ployee can't provide their social security card, you should 
verify their SSN and their eligibility for employment as dis-
cussed later in this section under Verification of SSNs .
Don't accept a social security card that says “Not 
valid for employment.” An SSN issued with this 
legend doesn't permit employment.
Y ou may, but aren't required to, photocopy the social 
security card if the employee provides it. If you don't pro-
vide the correct employee name and SSN on Form W -2, 
you may owe a penalty unless you have reasonable 
cause. See Pub. 1586, Reasonable Cause Regulations & 
Requirements for Missing and Incorrect Name/TINs on In-
formation Returns, for information on the requirement to 
solicit the employee's SSN.
In many cases, a replacement social security card 
can be applied for online without visiting an SSA 
office. In some cases, an SSN application can 
also be started online before visiting an SSA office. For 
more information, go to SSA.gov/number-card .
Applying for a social security card.  Any employee 
who is legally eligible to work in the United States and 
doesn't have a social security card can get one by com-
pleting Form SS -5, Application for a Social Security Card, 
and submitting the necessary documentation. Y ou can get 
Form SS -5 from the SSA website at SSA.gov/forms/
ss-5.pdf , at SSA offices, or by calling 800 -772- 1213 or 
800-325- 0778 (TTY). The employee must complete and 
sign Form SS -5; it can't be filed by the employer. Y ou may 
be asked to supply a letter to accompany Form SS -5 if the 
employee has exceeded their yearly or lifetime limit for the 
number of replacement cards allowed.

ries. Below is a list of the U.S. SSA offices located in the 
U.S. territories.

est SSA office in Puerto Rico.
Applying for an SSN.  If you file Form W -2 on paper and 
your employee applied for an SSN but doesn't have one 
when you must file Form W -2, enter “Applied For” on the 
form. If you’re filing electronically, enter all zeros 
(000-00- 0000 if creating forms online or 000000000 if up-
loading a file) in the SSN field. When the employee re-
ceives the SSN, file Copy A of Form W -2c, Corrected 
Wage and T ax Statement, with the SSA to show the em-
ployee's SSN. Furnish Copies B, C, and 2 of Form W -2c to 
the employee. Up to 25 Forms W -2c for each Form W -3c, 
T ransmittal of Corrected Wage and T ax Statements, may 
be filed per session online with no limit on the number of 
sessions. For more information, go to the SSA's Employer 
W-2 Filing Instructions & Information webpage at 
SSA.gov/employer . Advise your employee to correct the 
SSN on their original Form W-2.
Correctly record the employee's name and SSN.  Re-
cord the name and SSN of each employee as they’re 
shown on the employee's social security card. If the em-
ployee's name isn't correct as shown on the card (for ex-
ample, because of marriage or divorce), the employee 
should request an updated card from the SSA. Continue 
to report the employee's wages under the old name until 
the employee shows you the updated social security card 
with the corrected name.
If the SSA issues the employee an updated card after a 
name change, or a new card with a different SSN after a 
change in alien work status, file a Form W -2c to correct 
the name/SSN reported for the most recently filed Form 
W-2. It isn't necessary to correct other years if the previ-
ous name and number were used for years before the 
most recent Form W-2.
IRS individual taxpayer identification numbers 
(ITINs) for aliens.  Don't accept an ITIN in place of an 
SSN for employee identification or for work. An ITIN is 
only available to resident and nonresident aliens who 
aren't eligible for U.S. employment and need identification 
for other tax purposes. Y ou can identify an ITIN because it 
is a nine -digit number, formatted like an SSN, that starts 
with the number "9" and has a range of numbers from “50–
65,” “70–88,” “90–92,” and “94–99” for the fourth and fifth 
digits (for example, 9NN -7N- NNNN). For more information 
about ITINs, see the Instructions for Form W -7 or go to 
IRS.gov/ITIN .

The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing.
An individual with an ITIN who later becomes eli-
gible to work in the United States must obtain an 
SSN. If the individual is currently eligible to work 
in the United States, instruct the individual to apply for an 
SSN and follow the instructions under Applying for an 
SSN , earlier in this section. Don't use an ITIN in place of 
an SSN on Form W-2.
Verification of SSNs.  Employers and authorized report-
ing agents can use the Social Security Number Verifica-
tion Service (SSNVS) to instantly verify that an employee 
name matches an SSN for up to 10 names and SSNs (per 
screen) at a time, or submit an electronic file of up to 
250,000 names and SSNs and usually receive the results 
the next business day. Go to SSA.gov/employer/ssnv.htm 
for more information. A person may have a valid SSN but 
not be authorized to work in the United States. Employers 
may use E -Verify at E-Verify.gov  to confirm the employ-
ment eligibility of newly hired employees.
Accessing the SSNVS.  The SSA’s BSO is used to 
access the SSNVS. BSO users will need a social security 
online account. Y ou can use your personal my Social Se-
curity  account that was created before September 18, 
2021, or an existing Login.gov  credential or ID.me  creden-
tial. If you don’t have a social security online account, a 
Login.gov  credential, or an ID.me  credential, you’ll need to 
create one. For more information, go to the SSA’s website 
at SSA.gov/bso .
5. Wages and Other 
Compensation
Wages subject to federal employment taxes generally in-
clude all pay you give to an employee for services per-
formed. The pay may be in cash or in other forms. It in-
cludes salaries, vacation allowances, bonuses, 
commissions, and taxable fringe benefits. It doesn't matter 
how you measure or make the payments. Amounts an em-
ployer pays as a bonus for signing or ratifying a contract in 
connection with the establishment of an employer -em-
ployee relationship and an amount paid to an employee 
for cancellation of an employment contract and relinquish-
ment of contract rights are wages subject to social secur-
ity, Medicare, and FUTA taxes and income tax withhold-
ing. Also, compensation paid to a former employee for 
services performed while still employed is wages subject 
to employment taxes.
Cash wages paid to farmworkers.  Cash wages that 
you pay to employees for farmwork are generally subject 
to social security tax and Medicare tax. Y ou may also be 
required to withhold, deposit, and report Additional Medi-
care T ax. See section 9  for more information. If the wages 
are subject to social security and Medicare taxes, they’re 
also subject to federal income tax withholding. Y ou’re lia-
ble for the payment of these taxes to the federal govern-
ment whether or not you collect them from your employ-
ees. If, for example, you withhold less than the correct tax 
CAUTION!from an employee's wages, you’re still liable for the full 
amount. Y ou may also be liable for FUTA tax, which isn't 
withheld by you or paid by the employee. FUTA tax is dis-
cussed in section 14 . Cash wages include checks, money 
orders, and any kind of money or cash.
More information.  See section 6  for a discussion of tips 
and section 7  for a discussion of supplemental wages. 
Also, see section 15  for exceptions to the general rules for 
wages. Pub. 15 -A provides additional information on wa-
ges, including nonqualified deferred compensation, and 
other compensation. Pub. 15 -B provides information on 
other forms of compensation, including:
•Accident and health benefits,
•Achievement awards,
•Adoption assistance,
•Athletic facilities,
•De minimis (minimal) benefits,
•Dependent care assistance,
•Educational assistance,
•Employee discounts,
•Employee stock options,
•Employer-provided cell phones,
•Group-term life insurance coverage,
•Health savings accounts,
•Lodging on your business premises,
•Meals,
•No-additional-cost services,
•Retirement planning services,
•T ransportation (commuting) benefits,
•T uition reduction, and
•Working condition benefits.
Noncash wages, including commodity wages, paid to 
farmworkers. Noncash wages include food, lodging, 
clothing, transportation passes, farm products, or other 
goods or commodities. Noncash wages paid to farmwork-
ers, including commodity wages, aren't subject to social 
security taxes, Medicare taxes, or federal income tax with-
holding. However, you and your employee can agree to 
have federal income tax withheld on noncash wages.
Noncash wages, including commodity wages, are trea-
ted as cash wages if the substance of the transaction is a 
cash payment. Noncash wages treated as cash wages 
are subject to social security taxes, Medicare taxes, and 
federal income tax withholding.
Report the value of noncash wages in box 1 of Form 
W-2 (box 7 of Form 499R -2/W- 2PR) together with cash 
wages. Noncash wages for farmwork are subject to fed-
eral income tax unless a specific exclusion applies. Don't 
show noncash wages in box 3 or 5 of Form W -2 (box 20 or 
22 of Form 499R -2/W- 2PR), unless the substance of the 
Publication 15 (2025) 17

transaction is a cash payment and they’re being treated as 
cash wages.
Share farmers.  Y ou don't have to withhold or pay social 
security and Medicare taxes on amounts paid to share 
farmers under share-farming arrangements.
A “share farmer” working for you isn’t your employee. 
However, the share farmer may be subject to self -employ-
ment tax. In general, share farming is an arrangement in 
which certain commodity products are shared between 
the farmer and the owner (or tenant) of the land. For de-
tails, see Regulations section 31.3121(b)(16)-1.
Compensation paid to H -2A visa holders.  Report 
compensation of $600 or more paid to foreign agricultural 
workers who entered the country on H-2A visas in box 1 of 
Form W -2 (box 7 of Form 499R -2/W- 2PR) but don't report 
it as social security wages (box 3 of Form W-2 or box 20 of 
Form 499R -2/W- 2PR) or Medicare wages (box 5 of Form 
W-2 or box 22 of Form 499R -2/W- 2PR) on Form W -2 be-
cause compensation paid to H -2A workers for agricultural 
labor performed in connection with this visa isn't subject to 
social security and Medicare taxes. On Form W -2, don't 
check box 13 (Statutory employee), as H -2A workers 
aren't statutory employees.
An employer isn't required to withhold federal income 
tax from compensation paid to an H -2A worker for agricul-
tural labor performed in connection with this visa but may 
withhold if the worker asks for withholding and the em-
ployer agrees. In that case, the worker must give the em-
ployer a completed Form W -4. Federal income tax with-
held should be reported in box 2 of Form W-2.
These reporting rules apply when the H -2A worker pro-
vides their TIN to the employer. If the H -2A worker doesn't 
provide a TIN and the total annual wages to the H -2A 
worker are at least $600, the employer is required to 
backup withhold. See the Instructions for Forms 
1099- MISC and 1099 -NEC and the Instructions for Form 
945.
For more information on foreign agricultural workers on 
H-2A visas, go to IRS.gov/H2A .
Employee business expense reimbursements.  A re-
imbursement or allowance arrangement is a system by 
which you pay the advances, reimbursements, and 
charges for your employees' business expenses. How you 
report a reimbursement or allowance amount depends on 
whether you have an accountable or a nonaccountable 
plan. If a single payment includes both wages and an ex-
pense reimbursement, you must specify the amount of the 
reimbursement.
These rules apply to all allowable ordinary and neces-
sary employee business expenses.
Accountable plan.  T o be an accountable plan, your 
reimbursement or allowance arrangement must require 
your employees to meet all three of the following rules.
1.They must have paid or incurred allowable expenses 
while performing services as your employees. The re-
imbursement or advance must be payment for the ex-
penses and must not be an amount that would have 
otherwise been paid to the employee as wages.2.They must substantiate these expenses to you within 
a reasonable period of time.
3.They must return any amounts in excess of substanti-
ated expenses within a reasonable period of time.
Amounts paid under an accountable plan aren't wages 
and aren't subject to income, social security, Medicare, 
and FUTA taxes.
If the expenses covered by this arrangement aren't sub-
stantiated (or amounts in excess of substantiated expen-
ses aren't returned within a reasonable period of time), the 
amount paid under the arrangement in excess of the sub-
stantiated expenses is treated as paid under a nonac-
countable plan. This amount is subject to income, social 
security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes for the first payroll pe-
riod following the end of the reasonable period of time.
A reasonable period of time depends on the facts and 
circumstances. Generally, it is considered reasonable if 
your employees receive their advance within 30 days of 
the time they pay or incur the expenses, adequately ac-
count for the expenses within 60 days after the expenses 
were paid or incurred, and return any amounts in excess 
of expenses within 120 days after the expenses were paid 
or incurred. Alternatively, it is considered reasonable if you 
give your employees a periodic statement (at least quar-
terly) that asks them to either return or adequately account 
for outstanding amounts and they do so within 120 days.
Nonaccountable plan.  Payments to your employee 
for travel and other necessary expenses of your business 
under a nonaccountable plan are wages and are treated 
as supplemental wages and subject to income, social se-
curity, Medicare, and FUTA taxes. Y our payments are trea-
ted as paid under a nonaccountable plan if:
•Y our employee isn't required to or doesn't substantiate 
timely those expenses to you with receipts or other 
documentation,
•Y ou advance an amount to your employee for busi-
ness expenses and your employee isn't required to or 
doesn't return timely any amount they don’t use for 
business expenses,
•Y ou advance or pay an amount to your employee re-
gardless of whether you reasonably expect the em-
ployee to have business expenses related to your 
business, or
•Y ou pay an amount as a reimbursement you would 
have otherwise paid as wages.
See section 7  for more information on supplemental 
wages.
Per diem or other fixed allowance.  Y ou may reim-
burse your employees by travel days, miles, or some other 
fixed allowance under the applicable revenue procedure. 
In these cases, your employee is considered to have ac-
counted to you if your reimbursement doesn't exceed 
rates established by the federal government. The stand-
ard mileage rate for auto expenses is provided in Pub. 
15-B. 
The government per diem rates for meals and lodging 
in the continental United States can be found by going to

the U.S. General Services Administration website at 
GSA.gov/PerDiemRates . Other than the amount of these 
expenses, your employees' business expenses must be 
substantiated (for example, the business purpose of the 
travel or the number of business miles driven). For infor-
mation on substantiation methods, see Pub. 463, T ravel, 
Gift, and Car Expenses.
If the per diem or allowance paid exceeds the amounts 
substantiated, you must report the excess amount as wa-
ges. This excess amount is subject to income tax with-
holding and payment of social security, Medicare, and 
FUTA taxes. Show the amount equal to the substantiated 
amount (that is, the nontaxable portion) in box 12 of Form 
W-2 using code “L.” Employers in Puerto Rico report the 
amount in box 12 (no code needed).
Wages not paid in money.  If in the course of your trade 
or business you pay your employees in a medium that is 
neither cash nor a readily negotiable instrument, such as a 
check, you’re said to pay them “in kind.” Payments in kind 
may be in the form of goods, lodging, food, clothing, or 
services. Generally, the FMV of such payments at the time 
they’re provided is subject to federal income tax withhold-
ing and social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes.
However, noncash payments for household work, agri-
cultural labor, and service not in the employer's trade or 
business are exempt from social security, Medicare, and 
FUTA taxes. Withhold income tax on these payments only 
if you and the employee agree to do so. Nonetheless, non-
cash payments for agricultural labor, such as commodity 
wages, are treated as cash payments subject to employ-
ment taxes if the substance of the transaction is a cash 
payment. See Noncash wages, including commodity wa-
ges, paid to farmworkers , earlier in this section, for more 
information.
Meals and lodging.  The value of meals isn't taxable in-
come and isn't subject to federal income tax withholding 
and social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes if the meals 
are furnished for the employer's convenience and on the 
employer's premises. The value of lodging isn't subject to 
federal income tax withholding and social security, Medi-
care, and FUTA taxes if the lodging is furnished for the 
employer's convenience, on the employer's premises, and 
as a condition of employment.
“For the convenience of the employer” means you have 
a substantial business reason for providing the meals and 
lodging other than to provide additional compensation to 
the employee. For example, meals you provide at the 
place of work so that an employee is available for emer-
gencies during their lunch period are generally considered 
to be for your convenience. Y ou must be able to show 
these emergency calls have occurred or can reasonably 
be expected to occur, and that the calls have resulted, or 
will result, in you calling on your employees to perform 
their jobs during their meal period.
Whether meals or lodging are provided for the conven-
ience of the employer depends on all of the facts and cir-
cumstances. A written statement that the meals or lodging 
are for your convenience isn't sufficient.50% test.  If over 50% of the employees who are pro-
vided meals on an employer's business premises receive 
these meals for the convenience of the employer, all 
meals provided on the premises are treated as furnished 
for the convenience of the employer. If this 50% test is 
met, the value of the meals is excludable from income for 
all employees and isn't subject to federal income tax with-
holding or employment taxes. For more information, see 
Pub. 15-B.
Health insurance plans.  If you pay the cost of an acci-
dent or health insurance plan for your employees, includ-
ing an employee's spouse and dependents, your pay-
ments aren't wages and aren't subject to social security, 
Medicare, and FUTA taxes, or federal income tax with-
holding. Generally, this exclusion also applies to qualified 
long-term- care insurance contracts. However, for income 
tax withholding, the value of health insurance benefits 
must be included in the wages of S corporation employ-
ees who own more than 2% of the S corporation (2% 
shareholders). For social security, Medicare, and FUTA 
taxes, the health insurance benefits are excluded from the 
2% shareholder's wages. See Announcement 92 -16 for 
more information. Y ou can find Announcement 92 -16 on 
page 53 of Internal Revenue Bulletin 1992-5.
Health savings accounts (HSAs) and medical sav-
ings accounts (MSAs).  Y our contributions to an employ-
ee's HSA or Archer MSA aren't subject to social security, 
Medicare, or FUTA tax, or federal income tax withholding 
if it is reasonable to believe at the time of payment of the 
contributions they’ll be excludable from the income of the 
employee. T o the extent it isn't reasonable to believe they’ll 
be excludable, your contributions are subject to these 
taxes. Employee contributions to their HSAs or MSAs 
through a payroll deduction plan must be included in wa-
ges and are subject to social security, Medicare, and 
FUTA taxes, and federal income tax withholding. However, 
HSA contributions made under a salary reduction ar-
rangement in a section 125 cafeteria plan aren't wages 
and aren't subject to employment taxes or withholding. For 
more information, see the Instructions for Form 8889.
Medical care reimbursements.  Generally, medical care 
reimbursements paid for an employee under an employ-
er's self- insured medical reimbursement plan aren't wages 
and aren't subject to social security, Medicare, and FUTA 
taxes, or federal income tax withholding. See Pub. 15 -B 
for a rule regarding inclusion of certain reimbursements in 
the gross income of highly compensated individuals.
Differential wage payments.  Differential wage pay-
ments are any payments made by an employer to an indi-
vidual for a period during which the individual is perform-
ing service in the uniformed services while on active duty 
for a period of more than 30 days and represent all or a 
portion of the wages the individual would have received 
from the employer if the individual were performing serv-
ices for the employer.
Differential wage payments are wages for income tax 
withholding, but aren't subject to social security, Medicare, 
or FUTA tax. Employers should report differential wage

payments in box 1 of Form W -2 (box 7 of Form 499R -2/
W-2PR). For more information about the tax treatment of 
differential wage payments, see Revenue Ruling 2009 -11, 
2009- 18 I.R.B. 896, available at IRS.gov/irb/
2009-18_IRB#RR-2009-11 .
Fringe benefits.  Y ou must generally include fringe bene-
fits in an employee's wages (but see Nontaxable fringe 
benefits  next). The benefits are subject to income tax with-
holding and employment taxes. Fringe benefits include 
cars you provide, flights on aircraft you provide, free or dis-
counted commercial flights, vacations, discounts on prop-
erty or services, memberships in country clubs or other 
social clubs, and tickets to entertainment or sporting 
events. In general, the amount you must include is the 
amount by which the FMV of the benefit is more than the 
sum of what the employee paid for it plus any amount the 
law excludes. There are other special rules you and your 
employees may use to value certain fringe benefits. See 
Pub. 15-B for more information.
Nontaxable fringe benefits.  Some fringe benefits 
aren't taxable (or are minimally taxable) if certain condi-
tions are met. See Pub. 15 -B for details. The following are 
some examples of nontaxable fringe benefits.
•Services provided to your employees at no additional 
cost to you.
•Qualified employee discounts.
•Working condition fringes that are property or services 
that would be allowable as a business expense or de-
preciation expense deduction to the employee if they 
had paid for them. Examples include a company car 
for business use and subscriptions to business maga-
zines.
•Certain minimal value fringes (including an occasional 
cab ride when an employee must work overtime and 
meals you provide at eating places you run for your 
employees if the meals aren't furnished at below cost).
•Qualified transportation fringes subject to specified 
conditions and dollar limitations (including transporta-
tion in a commuter highway vehicle, any transit pass, 
and qualified parking).
•The use of on-premises athletic facilities operated by 
you if substantially all of the use is by employees, their 
spouses, and their dependent children.
•Qualified tuition reduction an educational organization 
provides to its employees for education. For more in-
formation, see Pub. 970.
•Employer-provided cell phones provided primarily for 
a noncompensatory business reason.
However, don't exclude the following fringe benefits 
from the wages of highly compensated employees unless 
the benefit is available to other employees on a nondiscri-
minatory basis.
•No-additional-cost services.
•Qualified employee discounts.•Meals provided at an employer-operated eating fa-
cility.
•Reduced tuition for education.
For more information, including the definition of a highly 
compensated employee, see Pub. 15-B.
When taxable fringe benefits are treated as paid. 
Y ou may choose to treat certain taxable noncash fringe 
benefits as paid by the pay period, by the quarter, or on 
any other basis you choose, as long as you treat the bene-
fits as paid at least once a year. Y ou don't have to make a 
formal choice of payment dates or notify the IRS of the 
dates you choose. Y ou don't have to make this choice for 
all employees. Y ou may change methods as often as you 
like, as long as you treat all benefits provided in a calendar 
year as paid by December 31 of the calendar year. See 
section 4 of Pub. 15 -B for more information, including a 
discussion of the special accounting rule for fringe bene-
fits provided during November and December.
Valuation of fringe benefits.  Generally, you must de-
termine the value of fringe benefits no later than January 
31 of the next year. Before January 31, you may reasona-
bly estimate the value of the fringe benefits for purposes 
of withholding and depositing on time.
Withholding federal income tax on fringe benefits. 
Y ou may add the value of fringe benefits to regular wages 
for a payroll period and figure withholding taxes on the to-
tal, or you may withhold federal income tax on the value of 
the fringe benefits at the optional flat 22% supplemental 
wage rate. However, see Withholding on supplemental 
wages when an employee receives more than $1 million of 
supplemental wages during the calendar year  in section 7.
Y ou may choose not to withhold income tax on the 
value of an employee's personal use of a vehicle you pro-
vide. Y ou must, however, withhold social security and 
Medicare taxes on the use of the vehicle. See Pub. 15 -B 
for more information on this election.
Withholding social security and Medicare taxes on 
fringe benefits.  Y ou add the value of fringe benefits to 
regular wages for a payroll period and figure social secur-
ity and Medicare taxes on the total.
If you withhold less than the required amount of social 
security and Medicare taxes from the employee in a calen-
dar year but report and pay the proper amount, you may 
recover the taxes from the employee. See Pub. 15 -B for 
more information.
Depositing taxes on fringe benefits.  Once you 
choose when fringe benefits are paid, you must deposit 
taxes in the same deposit period you treat the fringe bene-
fits as paid. T o avoid a penalty, deposit the taxes following 
the general deposit rules for that deposit period.
If you determine by January 31 you overestimated the 
value of a fringe benefit at the time you withheld and de-
posited for it, you may claim a refund for the overpayment 
or have it applied to your next employment tax return. See 
Valuation of fringe benefits , earlier in this section. If you 
underestimated the value and deposited too little, you may 
be subject to a failure -to-deposit (FTD) penalty. See sec-
tion 11  for information on deposit penalties.

If you deposited the required amount of taxes but with-
held a lesser amount from the employee, you can recover 
from the employee the social security, Medicare, or in-
come taxes you deposited on their behalf and included in 
the employee's Form W -2. However, you must recover the 
income taxes before April 1 of the following year.
Back pay.  Back pay, including retroactive wage increa-
ses (but not amounts paid as liquidated damages), is 
taxed as ordinary wages in the year paid. For information 
on reporting back pay to the SSA, see Pub. 957.
Sick pay.  In general, sick pay is any amount you pay un-
der a plan to an employee who is unable to work because 
of sickness or injury. These amounts are sometimes paid 
by a third party, such as an insurance company or an em-
ployees' trust. In either case, these payments are subject 
to social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes. These taxes 
don't apply to sick pay paid more than 6 calendar months 
after the last calendar month in which the employee 
worked for the employer. The payments are always sub-
ject to federal income tax. See section 6 of Pub. 15 -A for 
more information.
Identity protection services.  The value of identity pro-
tection services provided by an employer to an employee 
isn't included in an employee's gross income and doesn't 
need to be reported on an information return (such as 
Form W -2) filed for an employee. This includes identity 
protection services provided before a data breach occurs. 
This exception doesn't apply to cash received instead of 
identity protection services or to proceeds received under 
an identity theft insurance policy. For more information, 
see Announcement 2015 -22, 2015 -35 I.R.B. 288, availa-
ble at IRS.gov/irb/2015-35_IRB#ANN-2015-22 ; and An-
nouncement 2016 -02, 2016 -3 I.R.B. 283, available at 
IRS.gov/irb/2016-03_IRB#ANN-2016-02 .
6. Tips
Y ou’re permitted to establish a system for elec-
tronic tip reporting by employees. See Regula-
tions section 31.6053-1(d).
Cash tips your employee receives from customers are 
generally subject to withholding. Y our employee must re-
port cash tips to you by the 10th of the month after the 
month the tips are received. Cash tips include tips paid by 
cash, check, debit card, and credit card. The report 
should include tips you paid over to the employee for 
charge customers, tips the employee received directly 
from customers, and tips received from other employees 
under any tip -sharing arrangement. Both directly and indi-
rectly tipped employees must report tips to you. No report 
is required for months when tips are less than $20. If you 
don’t give your employees any specific method to report 
tips (for example, an electronic tip reporting system), your 
employees must give you a statement reporting their tips. 
TIPThe statement must be signed and dated by the employee 
and must include:
•The employee's name, address, and SSN;
•Y our name and address;
•The month and year (or the beginning and ending 
dates, if the statement is for a period of less than 1 
calendar month) the report covers; and
•The total of tips received during the month or period.
Y ou may also suggest that your employees see Pub. 
531, Reporting Tip Income.
Collecting taxes on tips.  Y ou must collect federal in-
come tax, employee social security tax, and employee 
Medicare tax on the employee's tips. The withholding 
rules for withholding an employee's share of Medicare tax 
on tips also apply to withholding the Additional Medicare 
T ax once wages and tips exceed $200,000 in the calendar 
year.
Y ou can collect these taxes from the employee's wages 
(excluding tips) or from other funds they make available. 
See Tips are treated as supplemental wages  in section 7 
for more information. Stop collecting the employee social 
security tax when their wages and tips for tax year 2025 
reach $176,100; collect the income and employee Medi-
care taxes for the whole year on all wages and tips. Y ou’re 
responsible for the employer social security tax on wages 
and tips until the wages (including tips) reach the limit. 
Y ou’re responsible for the employer Medicare tax for the 
whole year on all wages and tips. Tips are considered to 
be paid at the time the employee reports them to you. De-
posit taxes on tips based on your deposit schedule as de-
scribed in section 11 . File Form 941 or Form 944 to report 
withholding and employment taxes on tips.
Ordering rule.  If, by the 10th of the month after the 
month for which you received an employee's report on 
tips, you don't have enough employee funds available to 
deduct the employee tax, you no longer have to collect it. 
If there aren't enough funds available, withhold taxes in 
the following order.
1.Withhold on regular wages and other compensation.
2.Withhold social security and Medicare taxes on tips.
3.Withhold income tax on tips.
Reporting tips.  Report tips and any collected and uncol-
lected social security and Medicare taxes on Form W -2 
(Form 499R -2/W- 2PR for employers in Puerto Rico) and 
on Form 941, lines 5b, 5c, and, if applicable, 5d (Form 
944, lines 4b, 4c, and, if applicable, 4d). Report a negative 
adjustment on Form 941, line 9 (Form 944, line 6), for the 
uncollected social security and Medicare taxes. Enter the 
amount of uncollected social security tax and Medicare 
tax in box 12 of Form W -2 with codes “A” and “B,” respec-
tively. On Form 499R -2/W- 2PR, enter the amount of un-
collected social security and Medicare taxes in boxes 25 
and 26, respectively. Don't include any uncollected Addi-
tional Medicare T ax in box 12 of Form W -2. For additional 
information on reporting tips, see section 13  and the 
General Instructions for Forms W -2 and W -3. Employers

in Puerto Rico, see the Instructions for Form W -3 (PR) and 
Form W-3C (PR).
Revenue Ruling 2012 -18 provides guidance for em-
ployers regarding social security and Medicare taxes im-
posed on tips, including information on the reporting of the 
employer share of social security and Medicare taxes un-
der section 3121(q), the difference between tips and serv-
ice charges, and the section 45B credit. See Revenue 
Ruling 2012 -18, 2012 -26 I.R.B. 1032, available at 
IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18 .
FUTA tax on tips.  If an employee reports to you in writ-
ing $20 or more of tips in a month, the tips are also subject 
to FUTA tax.
Allocated tips.  If you operate a large food or beverage 
establishment, you must report allocated tips under cer-
tain circumstances. However, don't withhold income, so-
cial security, or Medicare taxes on allocated tips.
A large food or beverage establishment is one that is lo-
cated in the 50 states or the District of Columbia, provides 
food or beverages for consumption on the premises, 
where tipping is customary, and where there were nor-
mally more than 10 employees on a typical business day 
during the preceding year.
The tips may be allocated by one of three meth-
ods— hours worked, gross receipts, or good faith agree-
ment. For information about these allocation methods, and 
for information about required electronic filing of Form 
8027, see the Instructions for Form 8027. For more infor-
mation on filing Form 8027 electronically with the IRS, see 
Pub. 1239.
Tip Rate Determination and Education Program.  Em-
ployers may participate in the Tip Rate Determination and 
Education Program. The program primarily consists of two 
voluntary agreements developed to improve tip income re-
porting by helping taxpayers to understand and meet their 
tip reporting responsibilities. The two agreements are the 
Tip Rate Determination Agreement (TRDA) and the Tip 
Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC). A tip agree-
ment, the Gaming Industry Tip Compliance Agreement 
(GITCA), is available for the gaming (casino) industry. For 
more information, see Pub. 3144.
More information.  Advise your employees to see Pub. 
531 or use the IRS Interactive T ax Assistant at IRS.gov/
TipIncome  for help in determining if their tip income is tax-
able and for information about how to report tip income.
7. Supplemental Wages
References to federal income tax withholding 
don't apply to employers in American Samoa, 
Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto Rico, un-
less you have employees who are subject to U.S. income 
tax withholding. Contact your local tax department for in-
formation about income tax withholding.
Supplemental wages are wage payments to an em-
ployee that aren't regular wages. They include, but aren't 
CAUTION!limited to, bonuses, commissions, overtime pay, payments 
for accumulated sick leave, severance pay, awards, prizes, 
back pay, reported tips, retroactive pay increases, and 
payments for nondeductible moving expenses. However, 
employers have the option to treat overtime pay and tips 
as regular wages instead of supplemental wages. Other 
payments subject to the supplemental wage rules include 
taxable fringe benefits and expense allowances paid un-
der a nonaccountable plan. How you withhold on supple-
mental wages depends on whether the supplemental pay-
ment is identified as a separate payment from regular 
wages. See Regulations section 31. 3402(g)- 1 for addi-
tional guidance. Also see Revenue Ruling 2008 -29, 
2008- 24 I.R.B. 1149, available at IRS.gov/irb/
2008-24_IRB#RR-2008-29 .
Withholding on supplemental wages when an em-
ployee receives more than $1 million of supplemen-
tal wages from you during the calendar year.  Special 
rules apply to the extent supplemental wages paid to any 
one employee during the calendar year exceed $1 million. 
If a supplemental wage payment, together with other sup-
plemental wage payments made to the employee during 
the calendar year, exceeds $1 million, the excess is sub-
ject to withholding at 37% (or the highest rate of income 
tax for the year). Withhold using the 37% rate without re-
gard to the employee's Form W -4. In determining supple-
mental wages paid to the employee during the year, in-
clude payments from all businesses under common 
control. For more information, see T reasury Decision 
9276, 2006 -37 I.R.B. 423, available at IRS.gov/irb/
2006-37_IRB#TD-9276 .
Withholding on supplemental wage payments to an 
employee who doesn't receive $1 million of supple-
mental wages during the calendar year.  If the supple-
mental wages paid to the employee during the calendar 
year are less than or equal to $1 million, the following rules 
apply in determining the amount of income tax to be with-
held.
Supplemental wages combined with regular wages. 
If you pay supplemental wages with regular wages but 
don't specify the amount of each, withhold federal income 
tax as if the total were a single payment for a regular pay-
roll period.
Supplemental wages identified separately from regu-
lar wages.  If you pay supplemental wages separately (or 
combine them in a single payment and specify the amount 
of each), the federal income tax withholding method de-
pends partly on whether you withhold income tax from 
your employee's regular wages.
1.If you withheld income tax from an employee's regular 
wages in the current or immediately preceding calen-
dar year, you can use one of the following methods for 
the supplemental wages.
a.Withhold a flat 22% (no other percentage al-
lowed).
b.If the supplemental wages are paid concurrently 
with regular wages, add the supplemental wages 
22 Publication 15 (2025)

to the concurrently paid regular wages and with-
hold federal income tax as if the total were a single 
payment for a regular payroll period. If there are no 
concurrently paid regular wages, add the supple-
mental wages to, alternatively, either the regular 
wages paid or to be paid for the current payroll pe-
riod or the regular wages paid for the preceding 
payroll period. Figure the income tax withholding 
as if the total of the regular wages and supplemen-
tal wages is a single payment. Subtract the tax al-
ready withheld or to be withheld from the regular 
wages. Withhold the remaining tax from the sup-
plemental wages. If there were other payments of 
supplemental wages paid during the payroll period 
made before the current payment of supplemental 
wages, aggregate all the payments of supplemen-
tal wages paid during the payroll period with the 
regular wages paid during the payroll period, fig-
ure the tax on the total, subtract the tax already 
withheld from the regular wages and the previous 
supplemental wage payments, and withhold the 
remaining tax.
2.If you didn't withhold income tax from the employee's 
regular wages in the current or immediately preceding 
calendar year, use method 1b.
Regardless of the method you use to withhold income tax 
on supplemental wages, they’re subject to social security, 
Medicare, and FUTA taxes.
Example 1.  Y ou pay John Peters a base salary on the 
first of each month. John’s most recent Form W -4 is from 
2018, and John is single, claims one withholding allow-
ance, and didn’t enter an amount for additional withhold-
ing on Form W -4. In January, John is paid $1,000. Y ou de-
cide to use the Wage Bracket Method of withholding. 
Using Worksheet 3 and the withholding tables in section 3 
of Pub. 15 -T , you withhold $11 from this amount. In Febru-
ary, John receives salary of $1,000 plus a commission of 
$500, which you combine with regular wages and don't 
separately identify. Y ou figure the withholding based on 
the total of $1,500. The correct withholding from the tables 
is $62.
Example 2.  Y ou pay Sharon Warren a base salary on 
the first of each month. Sharon submitted a 2025 Form 
W-4 and checked the box for Single or Married filing sepa-
rately. Sharon didn’t complete Steps 2, 3, and 4 on Form 
W-4. Sharon’s May 1 pay is $2,000. Y ou decide to use the 
Wage Bracket Method of withholding. Using Worksheet 2 
and the withholding tables in section 2 of Pub. 15 -T , you 
withhold $77. On May 15, Sharon receives a bonus of 
$1,000. Electing to use supplemental wage withholding 
method 1b, you do the following.
1.Add the bonus amount to the amount of wages from 
the most recent base salary pay date (May 1) ($2,000 
+ $1,000 = $3,000).
2.Determine the amount of withholding on the com-
bined $3,000 amount to be $190 using the wage 
bracket tables.3.Subtract the amount withheld from wages on the most 
recent base salary pay date (May 1) from the com-
bined withholding amount ($190 – $77 = $113).
4.Withhold $113 from the bonus payment.
Example 3.  The facts are the same as in Example 2 , 
except you elect to use the flat rate method of withholding 
on the bonus. Y ou withhold 22% of $1,000, or $220, from 
Sharon's bonus payment.
Example 4.  The facts are the same as in Example 2 , 
except you elect to pay Sharon a second bonus of $2,000 
on May 29. Using supplemental wage withholding method 
1b, you do the following.
1.Add the first and second bonus amounts to the 
amount of wages from the most recent base salary 
pay date (May 1) ($2,000 + $1,000 + $2,000 = 
$5,000).
2.Determine the amount of withholding on the com-
bined $5,000 amount to be $427 using the wage 
bracket tables.
3.Subtract the amounts withheld from wages on the 
most recent base salary pay date (May 1) and the 
amounts withheld from the first bonus payment from 
the combined withholding amount ($427 – $77 – $113 
= $237).
4.Withhold $237 from the second bonus payment.
Tips are treated as supplemental wages.  Withhold in-
come tax on tips from wages earned by the employee or 
from other funds the employee makes available. Don't 
withhold the income tax due on tips from employee tips. If 
an employee receives regular wages and reports tips, fig-
ure income tax withholding as if the tips were supplemen-
tal wages. If you withheld income tax from the regular wa-
ges in the current or immediately preceding calendar year, 
you can withhold on the tips by method 1a or 1b dis-
cussed earlier in this section under Supplemental wages 
identified separately from regular wages . If you didn’t with-
hold income tax from the regular wages in the current or 
immediately preceding calendar year, add the tips to the 
regular wages and withhold income tax on the total by 
method 1b discussed earlier. Employers also have the op-
tion to treat tips as regular wages rather than supplemen-
tal wages. Service charges aren't tips; therefore, withhold 
taxes on service charges as you would on regular wages.
Vacation pay.  Vacation pay is subject to withholding as if 
it were a regular wage payment. When vacation pay is in 
addition to regular wages for the vacation period (for ex-
ample, an annual lump -sum payment for unused vacation 
leave), treat it as a supplemental wage payment. If the va-
cation pay is for a time longer than your usual payroll pe-
riod, spread it over the pay periods for which you pay it.

8. Payroll Period
Y our payroll period is a period of service for which you 
usually pay wages. When you have a regular payroll pe-
riod, withhold income tax for that time period even if your 
employee doesn't work the full period.
No regular payroll period.  When you don't have a reg-
ular payroll period, withhold the tax as if you paid wages 
for a daily or miscellaneous payroll period. Figure the 
number of days (including Sundays and holidays) in the 
period covered by the wage payment. If the wages are un-
related to a specific length of time (for example, commis-
sions paid on completion of a sale), count back the num-
ber of days from the payment period to the latest of:
•The last wage payment made during the same calen-
dar year;
•The date employment began, if during the same cal-
endar year; or
•January 1 of the same year.
Employee paid for period less than 1 week.  When 
you pay an employee for a period of less than 1 week, and 
the employee signs a statement under penalties of perjury 
indicating they aren’t working for any other employer dur-
ing the same week for wages subject to withholding, figure 
withholding based on a weekly payroll period. If the em-
ployee later begins to work for another employer for wages 
subject to withholding, the employee must notify you 
within 10 days. Y ou then figure withholding based on the 
daily or miscellaneous period.
9. Withholding From 
Employees' Wages
References to federal income tax withholding 
don't apply to employers in American Samoa, 
Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto Rico, un-
less you have employees who are subject to U.S. income 
tax withholding. Contact your local tax department for in-
formation about income tax withholding.
Federal Income Tax Withholding
Redesigned Form W -4. The IRS redesigned Form W -4 
for 2020 and subsequent years. Before 2020, the value of 
a withholding allowance was tied to the amount of the per-
sonal exemption. Due to changes in the law, taxpayers 
can no longer claim personal exemptions or dependency 
exemptions; therefore, Form W -4 no longer asks an em-
ployee to report the number of withholding allowances that 
they are claiming. The revised Form W -4 is divided into 
five steps. Step 1 and Step 5 apply to all employees. In 
Step 1, employees enter personal information like their 
name and filing status. In Step 5, employees sign the 
form. Employees who complete only Step 1 and Step 5 
CAUTION!will have their withholding figured based on their filing sta-
tus's standard deduction and tax rates with no other ad-
justments. If applicable, in Step 2, employees increase 
their withholding to account for higher tax rates due to in-
come from other jobs in their household. Under Step 2, 
employees either enter an additional amount to withhold 
per payroll period in Step 4(c) or check the box in Step 
2(c) for higher withholding rate tables to apply to their wa-
ges. In Step 3, employees decrease their withholding by 
reporting the annual amount of any credits they will claim 
on their income tax return. In Step 4, employees may in-
crease or decrease their withholding based on the annual 
amount of other income or deductions they will report on 
their income tax return and they may also request any ad-
ditional federal income tax they want withheld each pay 
period.
An employee who submitted Form W -4 in any year be-
fore 2020 isn’t required to submit a new form merely be-
cause of the redesign. Employers will continue to figure 
withholding based on the information from the employee's 
most recently submitted Form W -4. The withholding tables 
in Pub. 15 -T allow employers to figure withholding based 
on a Form W -4 for 2019 or earlier, as well as the rede-
signed Form W -4. While you may ask your employee who 
was first paid wages before 2020 who hasn’t yet submitted 
a redesigned Form W -4 to submit a new Form W -4 using 
the redesigned version of the form, you should explain to 
them that they’re not required to do this and if they don't 
submit a new Form W -4, withholding will continue based 
on a valid Form W -4 previously submitted. All newly hired 
employees must use the redesigned form. Similarly, any 
other employees who wish to adjust their withholding must 
use the redesigned form.
Pub. 15 -T provides an optional computational bridge to 
treat 2019 and earlier Forms W -4 as if they were 2020 or 
later Forms W -4 for purposes of figuring federal income 
tax withholding. This computational bridge allows you to 
use computational procedures and data fields for a 2020 
and later Form W -4 to arrive at the equivalent withholding 
for an employee that would have applied using the compu-
tational procedures and data fields on a 2019 or earlier 
Form W- 4. See How T o T reat 2019 and Earlier Forms W -4 
as if They Were 2020 or Later Forms W -4 under Introduc-
tion in Pub. 15-T .
More information.  For more information about the re-
designed Form W -4 and regulations that provide guidance 
for employers concerning income tax withholding from 
employees’ wages, see T reasury Decision 9924, 2020 -44

ployee withholding are provided in Pub. 15 -T , available at

federal income tax from the wages of farmworkers 
if the wages are subject to social security and 
Medicare taxes.

wages, you should have a Form W -4 on file for each em-
ployee. Encourage your employees to file an updated 
Form W -4 for 2025, especially if they owed taxes or re-
ceived a large refund when filing their 2024 tax return.
Ask all new employees to give you a signed Form W -4 
when they start work. Make the form effective with the first 
wage payment. If a new employee doesn't give you a com-
pleted Form W -4 in 2025 (including an employee who pre-
viously worked for you and was rehired in 2025, and who 
fails to furnish a Form W -4), treat the new employee as if 
they had checked the box for Single or Married filing sepa-
rately in Step 1(c) and made no entries in Step 2, Step 3, 
or Step 4 of the 2025 Form W -4. An employee who was 
paid wages before 2020 and who failed to furnish a Form 
W-4 should continue to be treated as single and claiming 
zero allowances on a 2019 Form W -4. If you use the op-
tional computational bridge, described earlier under Rede-
signed Form W -4, you may treat this employee as if they 
had checked the box for Single or Married filing separately 
in Step 1(c), and made no entries in Step 2 and Step 3, an 
entry of $8,600 in Step 4(a), and an entry of zero in Step 
4(b) of the 2025 Form W-4.
Electronic system to receive Form W -4.  Y ou may 
establish a system to electronically receive Forms W -4 
from your employees. See Regulations section 31. 3402(f)
(5)-1(c) and Pub. 15-T for more information.
Effective date of Form W -4.  A Form W -4 for 2024 or 
earlier years remains in effect for 2025 unless the em-
ployee gives you a 2025 Form W -4. When you receive a 
new Form W -4 from an employee, don't adjust withholding 
for pay periods before the effective date of the new form. If 
an employee gives you a Form W -4 that replaces an exist-
ing Form W -4, begin withholding no later than the start of 
the first payroll period ending on or after the 30th day from 
the date when you received the replacement Form W -4. 
For exceptions, see Exemption from federal income tax 
withholding , IRS review of requested Forms W -4, and In-
valid Forms W -4, later in this section.
A Form W -4 that makes a change for the next cal-
endar year won't take effect in the current calen-
dar year.
Successor employer.  If you’re a successor employer 
(see Successor employer , later in this section), secure 
new Forms W -4 from the transferred employees unless 
the “Alternative Procedure” in section 5 of Revenue Proce-
dure 2004 -53 applies. See Revenue Procedure 2004 -53, 
2004- 34 I.R.B. 320, available at IRS.gov/irb/

Y ou may advise your employees to use the IRS 
T ax Withholding Estimator available at IRS.gov/
W4App  for help in determining how to complete 
their Forms W -4. An employee that makes a mid -year 
change to their withholding after using the IRS T ax With-
holding Estimator may be underwithheld or overwithheld 
once their Form W -4 is applied to the next full calendar 
year. Therefore, you should remind employees that made 
CAUTION!
TIPa mid -year change to revisit the IRS T ax Withholding Esti-
mator in early January and submit a new Form W -4 for the 
year.
Completing Form W-4.  The amount of any federal in-
come tax withholding must be based on filing status, in-
come (including income from other jobs), deductions, and 
credits. Y our employees may not base their withholding 
amounts on a fixed dollar amount or percentage. How-
ever, an employee may specify a dollar amount to be with-
held each pay period in addition to the amount of with-
holding based on filing status and other information 
reported on Form W-4.
Employees that are married filing jointly and have spou-
ses that also currently work, or employees that hold more 
than one job at the same time, should account for their 
higher tax rate by completing Step 2 of their 2025 Form 
W-4. Employees also have the option to report on their 
2025 Form W -4 other income they will receive that isn't 
subject to withholding and other deductions they will claim 
in order to increase the accuracy of their federal income 
tax withholding.
See Pub. 505 for more information about completing 
Form W -4. Along with Form W -4, you may wish to order 
Pub. 505 for use by your employees.
Don't accept any withholding or estimated tax pay-
ments from your employees in addition to withholding 
based on their Form W -4. If they require additional with-
holding, they should submit a new Form W -4 and, if nec-
essary, pay estimated tax by filing Form 1040 -ES or by 
making an electronic payment of estimated taxes. Em-
ployees who receive tips may provide funds to their em-
ployer for withholding on tips; see Collecting taxes on tips 
in section 6.
Exemption from federal income tax withholding. 
Generally, an employee may claim exemption from federal 
income tax withholding because they had no income tax 
liability last year and expect none this year. See the Form 
W-4 instructions for more information. However, the wa-
ges are still subject to social security and Medicare taxes. 
See also Invalid Forms W -4, later in this section.
A Form W -4 claiming exemption from withholding is ef-
fective when it is given to the employer and only for that 
calendar year. T o continue to be exempt from withholding, 
an employee must give you a new Form W -4 by February 
15. If the employee doesn't give you a new Form W -4 by 
February 15, begin withholding as if they had checked the 
box for Single or Married filing separately in Step 1(c) and 
made no entries in Step 2, Step 3, or Step 4 of the 2025 
Form W -4. If the employee provides a new Form W -4 
claiming exemption from withholding on February 16 or 
later, you may apply it to future wages but don't refund any 
taxes withheld while the exempt status wasn’t in place.
Withholding federal income taxes on the wages of 
nonresident alien employees.  In general, you must 
withhold federal income taxes on the wages of nonresi-
dent alien employees. However, see Pub. 515 for excep-
tions to this general rule. See section 5  for more guidance 
on H-2A visa workers.
Publication 15 (2025) 25

Withholding adjustment for nonresident alien em-
ployees.  Nonresident aliens may not claim the standard 
deduction on their tax returns; therefore, employers must 
add an amount to the wages of nonresident alien employ-
ees performing services within the United States in order 
to figure the amount of federal income tax to withhold from 
their wages. The amount is added to their wages solely for 
calculating federal income tax withholding. The amount 
isn’t included in any box on the employee's Form W -2 and 
doesn’t increase the income tax liability of the employee. 
The amount also doesn't increase the social security tax 
or Medicare tax liability of the employer or the employee, 
or the FUTA tax liability of the employer. See Withholding 
Adjustment for Nonresident Alien Employees  under Intro-
duction  in Pub. 15 -T for the amount to add to their wages 
for the payroll period.
Supplemental wage payment.  The adjustment for 
determining the amount of income tax withholding for non-
resident alien employees doesn't apply to a supplemental 
wage payment (see section 7 ) if the 37% mandatory flat 
rate withholding applies or if the 22% optional flat rate 
withholding is being used to calculate income tax with-
holding on the supplemental wage payment.
Nonresident alien employee's Form W -4.  When com-
pleting Forms W-4, nonresident aliens are required to:
•Not claim exemption from income tax withholding 
(even if they meet both of the conditions to claim ex-
emption from withholding listed in the Form W-4 in-
structions);
•Request withholding as if they’re single, regardless of 
their actual filing status;
•Not claim the child tax credit or credit for other de-
pendents in Step 3 of Form W-4 (if the nonresident 
alien is a resident of Canada, Mexico, or South Korea, 
or a student from India, or a business apprentice from 
India, they may claim, under certain circumstances 
(see Pub. 519, U.S. T ax Guide for Aliens), the child tax 
credit or credit for other dependents); and
•Write “Nonresident Alien” or “NRA” in the space below 
Step 4(c) of Form W-4.
If you maintain an electronic Form W -4 system, you 
should provide a field for nonresident aliens to enter non-
resident alien status instead of writing “Nonresident Alien” 
or “NRA” in the space below Step 4(c) of Form W -4. Y ou 
should instruct nonresident aliens to see Notice 1392, 
Supplemental Form W -4 Instructions for Nonresident Ali-
ens, before completing Form W-4.
Form 8233.  If a nonresident alien employee claims a 
tax treaty exemption from withholding, the employee must 
submit Form 8233 with respect to the income exempt un-
der the treaty, instead of Form W -4. For more information, 
see the Instructions for Form 8233 and Pay for Personal 
Services Performed  under Withholding on Specific In-
come  in Pub. 515.
IRS review of requested Forms W -4.  When requested 
by the IRS, you must make original Forms W -4 available 
for inspection by an IRS employee. Y ou may also be direc-ted to send certain Forms W-4 to the IRS. Y ou may receive 
a notice from the IRS requiring you to submit a copy of 
Form W -4 for one or more of your named employees. 
Send the requested copy or copies of Form W -4 to the 
IRS at the address provided and in the manner directed by 
the notice. The IRS may also require you to submit copies 
of Form W -4 to the IRS as directed by a revenue proce-
dure or notice published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
After submitting a copy of a requested Form W -4 to the 
IRS, continue to withhold federal income tax based on that 
Form W -4 if it is valid (see Invalid Forms W -4, later in this 
section). However, if the IRS later notifies you in writing 
that the employee isn't entitled to claim exemption from 
withholding or a claimed amount of deductions or credits, 
withhold federal income tax based on the effective date, 
employee's permitted filing status, and withholding in-
structions specified in the IRS notice (commonly referred 
to as a “lock-in letter”).
Initial lock -in letter.  The IRS uses information repor-
ted on Form W -2 to identify employees with withholding 
compliance problems. In some cases, if a serious under-
withholding problem is found to exist for a particular em-
ployee, the IRS may issue a lock -in letter to the employer 
specifying the employee's permitted filing status and pro-
viding withholding instructions for the specific employee. 
Y ou’ll also receive a copy for the employee that identifies 
the permitted filing status and provides a description of 
the withholding instructions you’re required to follow and 
the process by which the employee can provide additional 
information to the IRS for purposes of determining the ap-
propriate withholding and/or modifying the specified filing 
status. Y ou must furnish the employee copy to the em-
ployee within 10 business days of receipt if the employee 
is employed by you as of the date of the notice. Y ou may 
follow any reasonable business practice to furnish the em-
ployee copy to the employee. Begin withholding based on 
the notice on the date specified in the notice.
Implementation of lock -in letter.  When you receive 
the notice specifying the permitted filing status and provid-
ing withholding instructions, you may not withhold immedi-
ately on the basis of the notice. Y ou must begin withhold-
ing tax on the basis of the notice for any wages paid after 
the date specified in the notice. The delay between your 
receipt of the notice and the date to begin the withholding 
on the basis of the notice permits the employee time to 
contact the IRS.
Seasonal employees and employees not currently 
performing services.  If you receive a notice for an em-
ployee who isn't currently performing services for you, 
you’re still required to furnish the employee copy to the 
employee and withhold based on the notice if any of the 
following apply.
•Y ou’re paying wages for the employee's prior services 
and the wages are subject to income tax withholding 
on or after the date specified in the notice.
•Y ou reasonably expect the employee to resume serv-
ices within 12 months of the date of the notice.

The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing.
•The employee is on a leave of absence that doesn't 
exceed 12 months or the employee has a right to re-
employment after the leave of absence.
Termination and rehire of employees.  If you must 
furnish and withhold based on the notice and the employ-
ment relationship is terminated after the date of the notice, 
you must continue to withhold based on the notice if you 
continue to pay any wages subject to income tax withhold-
ing. Y ou must also withhold based on the notice or modifi-
cation notice (explained next) if the employee resumes the 
employment relationship with you within 12 months after 
the termination of the employment relationship.
Modification notice.  After issuing the notice specify-
ing the permitted filing status and providing withholding in-
structions, the IRS may issue a subsequent notice (modifi-
cation notice) that modifies the original notice. The 
modification notice may change the permitted filing status 
and withholding instructions. Y ou must withhold federal in-
come tax based on the effective date specified in the mod-
ification notice.
New Form W-4 after IRS notice.  After the IRS issues 
a notice or modification notice, if the employee provides 
you with a new Form W -4 claiming complete exemption 
from withholding or a completed Form W -4 that results in 
less withholding than would result under the IRS notice or 
modification notice, disregard the new Form W -4. Y ou 
must withhold based on the notice or modification notice 
unless the IRS notifies you to withhold based on the new 
Form W -4. If the employee wants to put a new Form W -4 
into effect that results in less withholding than required, 
the employee must contact the IRS.
If, after you receive an IRS notice or modification notice, 
your employee gives you a new completed Form W -4 that 
results in more withholding than would result under the no-
tice or modification notice, you must withhold tax based 
on the new Form W -4. Otherwise, disregard any subse-
quent Forms W -4 provided by the employee and withhold 
based on the IRS notice or modification notice.
If, in a year before 2020, you received a lock -in 
letter for an employee, then for 2025 you should 
continue to follow the instructions in the lock -in 
letter. Y ou will use the withholding methods described in 
Pub. 15 -T for an employee with a Form W -4 from 2019 or 
earlier, or you may use the optional computational bridge 
to treat 2019 and earlier Forms W -4 as if they were 2020 
or later Forms W -4 for purposes of figuring federal income 
tax withholding. See How T o T reat 2019 and Earlier Forms 
W-4 as if They Were 2020 or Later Forms W -4 under the 
Introduction  in Pub. 15 -T . Y ou should continue following 
the instructions in the pre -2020 lock -in letter until you re-
ceive a letter releasing your employee from the lock -in 
procedures, you receive a modification notice, or your em-
ployee gives you a new Form W -4 that results in more 
withholding than would result under the notice.
For additional information about employer withholding 
compliance, see IRS.gov/WHC .
Substitute Forms W -4.  Y ou’re encouraged to have your 
employees use the official version of Form W -4. Y ou may 
CAUTION!use a substitute version of Form W -4 to meet your busi-
ness needs. However, your substitute Form W -4 must 
contain language that is identical to the official Form W -4 
and your form must meet all current IRS rules for substi-
tute forms. At the time you provide your substitute form to 
the employee, you must provide them with all tables, in-
structions, and worksheets from the current Form W-4. For 
more information, see Pub. 15-T .
Y ou can't accept substitute Forms W -4 developed by 
employees. An employee who submits an employee -de-
veloped substitute Form W -4 after October 10, 2007, will 
be treated as failing to furnish a Form W -4. However, con-
tinue to honor any valid employee -developed Forms W -4 
you accepted before October 11, 2007.
Invalid Forms W-4. Any unauthorized change or addition 
to Form W -4 makes it invalid. This includes taking out any 
language by which the employee certifies the form is cor-
rect. A Form W -4 is also invalid if, by the date an em-
ployee gives it to you, they clearly indicate it is false. An 
employee who submits a false Form W -4 may be subject 
to a $500 penalty. Y ou may treat a Form W -4 as invalid if 
the employee wrote “exempt” below Step 4(c) and 
checked the box in Step 2(c) or entered numbers for 
Steps 3 and 4.
When you get an invalid Form W -4, don't use it to figure 
federal income tax withholding. T ell the employee it is in-
valid and ask for another one. If the employee doesn't give 
you a valid one, and you have an earlier Form W -4 for this 
employee that is valid, withhold as you did before. If you 
don't have an earlier Form W -4 that is valid, withhold tax 
as if the employee had checked the box for Single or Mar-
ried filing separately in Step 1(c) and made no entries in 
Step 2, Step 3, or Step 4 of the 2025 Form W -4. However, 
an employee who was paid wages in 2019 who never sub-
mitted a valid Form W -4 and submits an invalid Form W -4 
in 2025 should continue to be treated as single and claim-
ing zero allowances on a 2019 Form W -4. If you use the 
optional computational bridge, described earlier under Re-
designed Form W -4, you may treat this employee as if 
they had checked the box for Single or Married filing sepa-
rately in Step 1(c), and made no entries in Step 2 and 
Step 3, an entry of $8,600 in Step 4(a), and an entry of 
zero in Step 4(b) of the 2025 Form W-4.
Amounts exempt from levy on wages, salary, and 
other income.  If you receive a Notice of Levy on Wages, 
Salary, and Other Income (a notice in the Form 668 ser-
ies), you must withhold amounts as described in the in-
structions for these forms. Pub. 1494 has tables to figure 
the amount exempt from levy. If a levy issued in a prior 
year is still in effect and the taxpayer submits a new State-
ment of Exemptions and Filing Status, use the current 
year Pub. 1494 to figure the exempt amount.
Social Security and Medicare Taxes
The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) provides 
for a federal system of old -age, survivors, disability, and 
hospital insurance. The old -age, survivors, and disability 
insurance part is financed by the social security tax. The 
Publication 15 (2025) 27

hospital insurance part is financed by the Medicare tax. 
Each of these taxes is reported separately.
Generally, you’re required to withhold social security 
and Medicare taxes from your employees' wages and pay 
the employer share of these taxes. Certain types of wages 
and compensation aren't subject to social security and 
Medicare taxes. See section 5  and section 15  for details. 
Generally, employee wages are subject to social security 
and Medicare taxes regardless of the employee's age or 
whether they are receiving social security benefits. If the 
employee reported tips, see section 6 .
The $150 test or the $2,500 test for farmwork.  All 
cash wages that you pay to an employee during the year 
for farmwork are subject to social security and Medicare 
taxes and federal income tax withholding if either of the 
two tests below is met.
•Y ou pay cash wages to an employee of $150 or more 
in a year for farmwork (count all cash wages paid on a 
time, piecework, or other basis). The $150 test applies 
separately to each farmworker that you employ. If you 
employ a family of workers, each member is treated 
separately. Don't count wages paid by other employ-
ers.
•The total that you pay for farmwork (cash and non-
cash) to all your employees is $2,500 or more during 
the year.
Exceptions.  Annual cash wages of less than $150 
you pay to a seasonal  farmworker aren't subject to social 
security and Medicare taxes, or federal income tax with-
holding, even if you pay $2,500 or more to all your farm-
workers. However, these wages count toward the $2,500 
test for determining whether other farmworkers' wages are 
subject to social security and Medicare taxes.
A seasonal farmworker is a worker who:
•Is employed in agriculture as a hand-harvest laborer,
•Is paid piece rates in an operation that is usually paid 
on a piece-rate basis in the region of employment,
•Commutes daily from their permanent home to the 
farm, and
•Had been employed in agriculture less than 13 weeks 
in the preceding calendar year.
Wages paid to a child under 18 working on a farm that 
is a sole proprietorship or a partnership in which each 
partner is a parent of a child aren't subject to social secur-
ity and Medicare taxes. However, these wages count to-
ward the $2,500 test for determining whether other farm-
workers' wages are subject to social security and 
Medicare taxes.
Deducting the tax.  Deduct the employee tax from 
each wage payment. If you’re not sure that the wages that 
you pay to a farmworker during the year will be taxable, 
you may either deduct the tax when you make the pay-
ments or wait until the $2,500 test or the $150 test dis-
cussed earlier has been met.
Tax rates and the social security wage base limit.  So-
cial security and Medicare taxes have different rates and only the social security tax has a wage base limit. The 
wage base limit is the maximum wage subject to the tax 
for the year. Determine the amount of withholding for so-
cial security and Medicare taxes by multiplying each pay-
ment by the employee tax rate.
For 2025, the social security tax rate is 6.2% (amount 
withheld) each for the employer and employee (12.4% to-
tal). The social security wage base limit is $176,100. The 
tax rate for Medicare is 1.45% (amount withheld) each for 
the employee and employer (2.9% total). There is no wage 
base limit for Medicare tax; all covered wages are subject 
to Medicare tax.
Additional Medicare Tax withholding.  In addition to 
withholding Medicare tax at 1.45%, you must withhold a 
0.9% Additional Medicare T ax from wages you pay to an 
employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. Y ou’re 
required to begin withholding Additional Medicare T ax in 
the pay period in which you pay wages in excess of 
$200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each 
pay period until the end of the calendar year. Additional 
Medicare T ax is only imposed on the employee. There is 
no employer share of Additional Medicare T ax. All wages 
that are subject to Medicare tax are subject to Additional 
Medicare T ax withholding if paid in excess of the $200,000 
withholding threshold.
For more information on what wages are subject to 
Medicare tax, see section 15 . For more information on Ad-
ditional Medicare T ax, go to IRS.gov/ADMTfaqs .
Successor employer.  When corporate acquisitions 
meet certain requirements, wages paid by the predeces-
sor are treated as if paid by the successor for purposes of 
applying the social security wage base and for applying 
the Additional Medicare T ax withholding threshold (that is, 
$200,000 in a calendar year). Y ou should determine 
whether or not you should file Schedule D (Form 941), Re-
port of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory 
Mergers, or Consolidations, by reviewing the Instructions 
for Schedule D (Form 941). See Regulations section 
31.3121(a)(1)- 1(b) for more information. Also see Reve-
nue Procedure 2004 -53, 2004 -34 I.R.B. 320, available at 
IRS.gov/irb/2004-34_IRB#RP-2004-53 .
Example. Early in 2025, you bought all of the assets of 
a plumbing business from Adam Black. Julian Gold, who 
had been employed by Adam and received $2,000 in wa-
ges before the date of purchase, continued to work for 
you. The wages you paid to Julian are subject to social se-
curity tax on the first $174,100 ($176,100 minus $2,000). 
Medicare tax is due on all of the wages you pay Julian 
during the calendar year. Y ou should include the $2,000 
Julian received while employed by Adam in determining 
whether Julian's wages exceed the $200,000 for Addi-
tional Medicare T ax withholding threshold.
Employee's portion of taxes paid by employer.  If you 
pay your employee's social security and Medicare taxes 
without deducting them from the employee's pay, you 
must include the amount of the payments in the employ-
ee's wages for social security and Medicare taxes. This in-
crease in the employee's wage payment for your payment 
28 Publication 15 (2025)

of the employee's social security and Medicare taxes is 
also subject to employee social security and Medicare 
taxes. This again increases the amount of the additional 
taxes that you must pay. For more information, see Reve-
nue Ruling 86-14, 1986-1 C.B. 304, and Pub. 15-A.
Household and agricultural employers.  If you 
would rather pay a household or agricultural employee's 
share of the social security and Medicare taxes without 
withholding them from the employee’s wages, you may do 
so. If you don't withhold the taxes, however, you must still 
pay them on behalf of the employee. Any employee so-
cial security and Medicare taxes that you pay are addi-
tional income to the employee. Include it in box 1 of the 
employee's Form W- 2 (box 7 of Form 499R -2/W-2PR), but 
don't count it as social security and Medicare wages and 
don't include it in boxes 3 and 5 (boxes 20 and 22 of Form 
499R-2/W- 2PR). Also, don't count the additional income 
as wages for FUTA tax purposes. Different rules apply to 
employer payments of social security and Medicare taxes 
for non -household and non -agricultural employees. See 
section 7 of Pub. 15-A.
Example. Gavrielle operates a small family fruit farm. 
Gavrielle employs day laborers in the picking season to al-
low Gavrielle time to get the crops to market. Gavrielle 
doesn't deduct the employees' share of social security 
and Medicare taxes from their pay; instead, Gavrielle pays 
it on their behalf. When Gavrielle prepares the employees' 
Forms W -2, Gavrielle adds each employee's share of so-
cial security and Medicare taxes that Gavrielle paid to the 
employee's wage income (box 1 of Form W -2), but doesn't 
include it in box 3 (social security wages) or box 5 (Medi-
care wages and tips).
For 2025, Gavrielle paid Dan $1,000 during the year. 
Gavrielle enters $1,076.50 in box 1 of Dan's Form W -2 
($1,000 wages plus $76.50 social security and Medicare 
taxes paid for Dan). Gavrielle enters $1,000.00 in boxes 3 
and 5 of Dan's Form W-2.
Sick pay payments.  Social security and Medicare taxes 
apply to most payments of sick pay, including payments 
made by third parties such as insurance companies. For 
details on third-party payers of sick pay, see Pub. 15-A.
Motion picture project employers.  All wages paid by a 
motion picture project employer to a motion picture project 
worker during a calendar year are subject to a single so-
cial security tax wage base ($176,100 for 2025) and a sin-
gle FUTA tax wage base ($7,000 for 2025) regardless of 
the worker's status as a common -law employee of multiple 
clients of the motion picture project employer. For more in-
formation, including the definition of a motion picture 
project employer and a motion picture project worker, see 
section 3512.
Withholding social security and Medicare taxes on 
nonresident alien employees. In general, if you pay wa-
ges to nonresident alien employees, you must withhold 
social security and Medicare taxes as you would for a U.S. 
citizen or resident alien. However, see Pub. 515 for excep-
tions to this general rule. One such exception is for foreign agricultural workers on H -2A visas, who are exempt from 
social security and Medicare taxes. See Compensation 
paid to H -2A visa holders  in section 5. 
International social security agreements.  The United 
States has social security agreements, also known as to-
talization agreements, with many countries that eliminate 
dual social security coverage and taxation. Compensation 
subject to social security and Medicare taxes may be ex-
empt under one of these agreements. Y ou can get more 
information and a list of agreement countries from the 
SSA at SSA.gov/international . Also see Pub. 519.
Religious exemption.  An exemption from social secur-
ity and Medicare taxes is available to members of a recog-
nized religious sect opposed to insurance. This exemption 
is available only if both the employee and the employer 
are members of the sect. For more information, see Pub. 
517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of 
the Clergy and Religious Workers.
Foreign persons treated as American employers.  Un-
der section 3121(z), a foreign person who meets both of 
the following conditions is generally treated as an Ameri-
can employer for purposes of paying FICA taxes on wages 
paid to an employee who is a U.S. citizen or resident.
1.The foreign person is a member of a domestically 
controlled group of entities.
2.The employee of the foreign person performs services 
in connection with a contract between the U.S. Gov-
ernment (or an instrumentality of the U.S. Govern-
ment) and any member of the domestically controlled 
group of entities. Ownership of more than 50% consti-
tutes control.
Part-Time Workers
Part- time workers and workers hired for short periods of 
time are treated the same as full -time employees for fed-
eral income tax withholding and social security, Medicare, 
and FUTA tax purposes.
Generally, it doesn't matter whether the part -time 
worker or worker hired for a short period of time has an-
other job or has the maximum amount of social security 
tax withheld by another employer. See Successor em-
ployer , earlier in this section, for an exception to this rule.
Income tax withholding may be figured the same way 
as for full -time workers or it may be figured by the 
part- year employment method explained in section 6 of 
Pub. 15-T .
10. Required Notice to 
Employees About the Earned 
Income Credit (EIC)
Y ou must notify employees, except for employees in 
American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the CNMI, and the 
Publication 15 (2025) 29
Page 30 of 58  Fileid: … ication-15/2025/a/xml/cycle05/source 11:23 - 17-Dec-2024

USVI, who have no federal income tax withheld that they 
may be able to claim a tax refund because of the EIC. Al-
though you don't have to notify employees who claim ex-
emption from withholding on Form W -4 about the EIC, 
you’re encouraged to notify any employees whose wages 
for 2024 were less than $59,899 ($66,819 if married filing 
jointly) that they may be eligible to claim the credit for 
2024. This is because eligible employees may get a re-
fund of the amount of the EIC that is more than the tax 
they owe.
Y ou’ll meet this notification requirement if you issue the 
employee Form W -2 with the EIC notice on the back of 
Copy B, or a substitute Form W -2 with the same state-
ment. Y ou’ll also meet the requirement by providing Notice 
797, Possible Federal T ax Refund Due to the Earned In-
come Credit (EIC), or your own statement that contains 
the same wording.
If a substitute for Form W -2 is given to the employee on 
time but doesn't have the required statement, you must 
notify the employee within 1 week of the date the substi-
tute for Form W -2 is given. If Form W -2 is required but isn't 
given on time, you must give the employee Notice 797 or 
your written statement by the date Form W -2 is required to 
be given. If Form W -2 isn't required, you must notify the 
employee by February 7, 2025.
11. Depositing Taxes
Generally, you must deposit federal income tax withheld 
and both the employer and employee social security and 
Medicare taxes. Y ou must use EFT to make all federal tax 
deposits. See How T o Deposit , later in this section, for in-
formation on electronic deposit requirements.
Payment with return.  Y ou may make a payment with a 
timely filed Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 
instead of depositing, without incurring a penalty, if one of 
the following applies.
•Y ou’re a monthly schedule depositor (defined later) 
and make a payment in accordance with the Accuracy 
of Deposits Rule , discussed later in this section. This 
payment may be $2,500 or more.
•Y our Form 941 total tax liability (Form 941, line 12) for 
either the current quarter or the prior quarter is less 
than $2,500, and you didn't incur a $100,000 next-day 
deposit obligation during the current quarter. However, 
if you're unsure that your total tax liability for the cur-
rent quarter will be less than $2,500 (and your liability 
for the prior quarter wasn't less than $2,500), make 
deposits using the semiweekly or monthly rules so you 
won't be subject to an FTD penalty.
•Y our Form 943 total tax liability (Form 943, line 13) for 
the year is less than $2,500. However, if you're unsure 
that you will report less than $2,500, deposit under the 
rules explained in this section so that you won't be 
subject to an FTD penalty.
•Y our Form 944 total tax liability for the year (Form 944, 
line 9) is less than $2,500, or your Form 944 total tax liability for the year (Form 944, line 9) is $2,500 or 
more and you already deposited the taxes you owed 
for the first, second, and third quarters of the year; 
your net tax for the fourth quarter is less than $2,500; 
and you're paying, in full, the tax you owe for the fourth 
quarter with a timely filed return.
•Y our Form 945 total tax liability (Form 945, line 3) for 
the year is less than $2,500. However, if you're unsure 
that you will report less than $2,500, deposit under the 
rules explained in this section so that you won't be 
subject to an FTD penalty.
Separate deposit requirements for nonpayroll (Form 
945) tax liabilities.  Separate deposits are required for 
nonpayroll and payroll income tax withholding. Don't com-
bine deposits for Forms 941 (or Form 943 or Form 944) 
and Form 945 tax liabilities. Generally, the deposit rules 
for nonpayroll liabilities are the same as discussed next, 
except the rules apply to an annual rather than a quarterly 
return period. If the total amount of tax for the year repor-
ted on Form 945 is less than $2,500, you're not required to 
make deposits during the year. See the separate Instruc-
tions for Form 945 for more information.
Separate deposit requirements for employers of both 
farm and nonfarm workers.  If you employ both farm 
and nonfarm workers, you must treat employment taxes 
for the farmworkers (Form 943 taxes) separately from em-
ployment taxes for the nonfarm workers (Form 941/944 
taxes). Form 943 taxes and Form 941/944 taxes aren't 
combined for purposes of applying any of the deposit 
schedule rules. If a deposit is due, deposit the Form 
941/944 taxes and the Form 943 taxes by making sepa-
rate deposits. For example, if you're a monthly schedule 
depositor for both Form 941/944 taxes and Form 943 
taxes and your tax liability at the end of April is $1,500 re-
portable on Form 941/944 and $1,200 reportable on Form 
943, deposit both amounts by May 15. Use one transac-
tion to deposit the $1,500 of Form 941/944 taxes and an-
other transaction to deposit the $1,200 of Form 943 taxes.
When To Deposit
There are two deposit schedules —monthly and semi-
weekly— for determining when you deposit social security, 
Medicare, and withheld federal income taxes. These 
schedules tell you when a deposit is due after a tax liability 
arises. Y our tax liability is based on the dates payments 
were made or wages were paid. For taxable noncash 
fringe benefits, see When taxable fringe benefits are trea-
ted as paid  in section 5. Before the beginning of each cal-
endar year, you must determine which of the two deposit 
schedules you’re required to use. The deposit schedule 
you must use is based on the total tax liability you reported 
on Forms 941, line 12; Form 943, line 13; Form 944, line 9; 
or Form 945, line 3, during a lookback period, discussed 
next. Y our deposit schedule isn't determined by how often 
you pay your employees or make deposits. See special 
rules for Form 943, Form 944, and Form 945, later in this 
section. Also see Application of Monthly and Semiweekly 
Schedules , later in this section.

These rules don't apply to FUTA tax. See section 
14 for information on depositing FUTA tax.
Lookback period.  If you’re a Form 941 filer, your deposit 
schedule for a calendar year is determined from the total 
taxes reported on Forms 941, line 12, in a 4 -quarter look-
back period. The lookback period begins July 1 and ends 
June 30 as shown next in T able 1. If you reported $50,000 
or less of taxes for the lookback period, you’re a monthly 
schedule depositor; if you reported more than $50,000, 
you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor.

Sept. 30, 2023 Dec. 31, 2023 Mar. 31, 2024 June 30, 2024
The lookback period for a 2025 Form 941 filer 
who filed Form 944 in either 2023 or 2024 is cal-
endar year 2023.
If you’re a Form 943 or Form 944 filer for the current 
year or either of the preceding 2 years, your deposit 
schedule for a calendar year is determined from the total 
taxes reported during the second preceding calendar year 
(either on your Forms 941 for all 4 quarters of that year, 
your Form 943 for that year, or your Form 944 for that 
year). The lookback period for 2025 for a Form 943 or 
Form 944 filer is calendar year 2023. If you reported 
$50,000 or less of taxes for the lookback period, you’re a 
monthly schedule depositor; if you reported more than 
$50,000, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor.
If you’re a Form 945 filer, your deposit schedule for a 
calendar year is determined from the total taxes reported 
on line 3 of your Form 945 for the second preceding calen-
dar year. The lookback period for 2025 for a Form 945 filer 
is calendar year 2023.
Y our total tax liability for the lookback period is de-
termined based on the amount of taxes you repor-
ted on Forms 941, line 12; Form 943, line 13; or 
Form 944, line 9. Y our total liability isn’t reduced by the re-
fundable portion of the credit for qualified sick and family 
leave wages. For more information about this credit, see 
the instructions for your employment tax return that were 
applicable during the lookback period.
Adjustments and the lookback rule.  Adjustments 
made on Form 941-X, Form 943-X, Form 944-X, and Form 
945- X don't affect the amount of tax liability for previous 
periods for purposes of the lookback rule.
Example.  An employer originally reported a tax liabil-
ity of $45,000 for the lookback period. The employer dis-
covered, during January 2025, that the tax reported for 
one of the lookback period quarters was understated by 
$10,000 and corrected this error by filing Form 941-X. This 
employer is a monthly schedule depositor for 2025 be-
cause the lookback period tax liabilities are based on the 
amounts originally reported, and they were $50,000 or 
CAUTION!
CAUTION!
TIPless. The $10,000 adjustment is also not treated as part of 
the 2025 taxes.
Deposit period.  The term “deposit period” refers to the 
period during which tax liabilities are accumulated for 
each required deposit due date. For monthly schedule de-
positors, the deposit period is a calendar month. The de-
posit periods for semiweekly schedule depositors are 
Wednesday through Friday and Saturday through T ues-
day.
If you're an agent with an approved Form 2678, 
the deposit rules apply to you based on the total 
employment taxes accumulated by you for your 
own employees and on behalf of all employers for whom 
you're authorized to act. For more information on an agent 
with an approved Form 2678, see Revenue Procedure 
2013- 39, 2013 -52 I.R.B. 830, available at IRS.gov/irb/
2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39 .
Monthly Deposit Schedule
For Form 941 filers, you're a monthly schedule depositor 
for a calendar year if the total taxes on Forms 941, line 12, 
for the 4 quarters in your lookback period were $50,000 or 
less. For Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 filers, you're a 
monthly schedule depositor for a calendar year if the total 
taxes on Form 943, line 13; Form 944, line 9; or Form 945, 
line 3, during your lookback period were $50,000 or less. 
Under the monthly deposit schedule, deposit employment 
taxes on payments made during a month by the 15th day 
of the following month. See also Deposits Due on Busi-
ness Days Only  and $100,000 Next -Day Deposit Rule , 
later in this section. Monthly schedule depositors 
shouldn't file Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 
on a monthly basis.
New employers.  For Form 941 filers, your tax liability for 
any quarter in the lookback period before you started or 
acquired your business is considered to be zero. There-
fore, you’re a monthly schedule depositor for the first cal-
endar year of your business. For Form 943, Form 944, or 
Form 945 filers, your tax liability in the lookback period be-
fore you started or acquired your business is considered 
to be zero. Therefore, you're a monthly schedule depositor 
for the first and second calendar years of your business. 
However, see $100,000 Next -Day Deposit Rule , later in 
this section.
Semiweekly Deposit Schedule
For Form 941 filers, you're a semiweekly schedule deposi-
tor for a calendar year if the total taxes on Forms 941, 
line 12, during your lookback period were more than 
$50,000. For Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 filers, 
you're a semiweekly schedule depositor for a calendar 
year if the total taxes on Form 943, line 13; Form 944, 
line 9; or Form 945, line 3, during your lookback period 
were more than $50,000. Under the semiweekly deposit 
schedule, deposit employment taxes for payments made 
on Wednesday, Thursday, and/or Friday by the following 
Wednesday. Deposit taxes for payments made on

Semiweekly schedule depositors must complete 
Schedule B (Form 941), Report of T ax Liability for 
Semiweekly Schedule Depositors, and submit it 
with Form 941. If you file Form 943 and are a semiweekly 
schedule depositor, complete Form 943 -A, Agricultural 
Employer's Record of Federal T ax Liability, and submit it 
with Form 943. If you file Form 944 or Form 945 and are a 
semiweekly schedule depositor, complete Form 945 -A, 
Annual Record of Federal T ax Liability, and submit it with 
your return.

April 1, 2025 (second quarter), two separate deposits 
would be required even though the pay dates fall within 
the same semiweekly period. Both deposits would be due 
on Friday, April 4, 2025.
Semiweekly deposit period spanning 2 return peri-
ods (Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 filers). The pe-
riod covered by a return is the return period. The return 
period for annual Form 943, Form 944, and Form 945 is a 
calendar year. If you have more than 1 pay date during a 
semiweekly period and the pay dates fall in different return 
periods, you'll need to make separate deposits for the 
separate liabilities. For example, if a return period ends on 
Thursday, taxes accumulated on Wednesday and Thurs-
day are subject to one deposit obligation, and taxes accu-
mulated on Friday are subject to a separate obligation. 
Separate deposits are required because 2 different return 
periods are affected.
CAUTION!Summary of Steps To Determine Your Deposit Schedule
1.Identify your lookback period (see Lookback period , earlier in 
this section).
2.Add the total taxes you reported on Forms 941, line 12; Form 
943, line 13; Form 944, line 9; or Form 945, line 3, during the 
lookback period.
3.Determine if you’re a monthly or semiweekly schedule 
depositor:
IF the total taxes you 
reported in the lookback 
period were...THEN you’re a...
$50,000 or less monthly schedule depositor.
more than $50,000 semiweekly schedule 
depositor.
Example of Monthly and Semiweekly 
Schedules
Rose Co. reported Form 941 taxes as follows.
2024 Lookback Period 2025 Lookback Period
3rd Quarter 2022  $12,000 3rd Quarter 2023  $12,000
4th Quarter 2022  12,000 4th Quarter 2023  12,000
1st Quarter 2023  12,000 1st Quarter 2024  12,000
2nd Quarter 2023  12,000 2nd Quarter 2024 15,000
 $48,000  $51,000
Rose Co. is a monthly schedule depositor for 2024 be-
cause its tax liability for the 4 quarters in its lookback pe-
riod (third quarter 2022 through second quarter 2023) 
wasn't more than $50,000. However, for 2025, Rose Co. 
will be a semiweekly schedule depositor because the total 
taxes exceeded $50,000 for the 4 quarters in its lookback 
period (third quarter 2023 through second quarter 2024).
Example for employers of farmworkers.  Red Co. re-
ported taxes on its 2023 Form 943, line 13, of $48,000. On 
its 2024 Form 943, line 13, it reported taxes of $60,000.
Red Co. is a monthly schedule depositor for 2025 be-
cause its taxes for its lookback period ($48,000 for calen-
dar year 2023) weren't more than $50,000. However, for 
2026, Red Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor be-
cause the total taxes for its lookback period ($60,000 for 
calendar year 2024) exceeded $50,000.
Deposits Due on Business Days Only
If a deposit is required to be made on a day that isn't a 
business day, the deposit is considered timely if it is made 
by the close of the next business day. A business day is 
any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. 
For example, if a deposit is required to be made on a Fri-
day and Friday is a legal holiday, the deposit will be con-
sidered timely if it is made by the following Monday (if that 
Monday is a business day).
Semiweekly schedule depositors  have at least 3 
business days following the close of the semiweekly pe-
riod to make a deposit. If any of the 3 weekdays after the 
end of a semiweekly period is a legal holiday, you’ll have

an additional day for each day that is a legal holiday to 
make the required deposit. For example, if a semiweekly 
schedule depositor accumulated taxes for payments 
made on Friday and the following Monday is a legal holi-
day, the deposit normally due on Wednesday may be 
made on Thursday (this allows 3 business days to make 
the deposit).
Legal holiday.  The term “legal holiday” means any legal 
holiday in the District of Columbia. For purposes of the de-
posit rules, the term “legal holiday” doesn't include other 
statewide legal holidays. Legal holidays for 2025 are listed 
next.
•January 1—New Y ear's Day
•January 20—Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr./Inau-
guration Day
•February 17—Washington's Birthday
•April 16—District of Columbia Emancipation Day
•May 26—Memorial Day
•June 19—Juneteenth National Independence Day
•July 4—Independence Day
•September 1—Labor Day
•October 13—Indigenous Peoples' Day (Columbus 
Day)
•November 11—Veterans Day
•November 27—Thanksgiving Day
•December 25—Christmas Day
Application of Monthly and Semiweekly 
Schedules
The terms “monthly schedule depositor” and “semiweekly 
schedule depositor” don't refer to how often your business 
pays its employees or even how often you’re required to 
make deposits. The terms identify which set of deposit 
rules you must follow when an employment tax liability ari-
ses. The deposit rules are based on the dates when wa-
ges are paid (cash basis), not on when tax liabilities are 
accrued for accounting purposes.
Monthly schedule example.  Spruce Co. is a monthly 
schedule depositor with seasonal employees. It paid wa-
ges each Friday during March but didn't pay any wages 
during April. Under the monthly deposit schedule, Spruce 
Co. must deposit the combined tax liabilities for the March 
paydays by April 15. Spruce Co. doesn't have a deposit 
requirement for April (due by May 15) because no wages 
were paid and, therefore, it didn't have a tax liability for 
April.
Semiweekly schedule example.  Green, Inc., is a semi-
weekly schedule depositor and pays wages once each 
month on the last Friday of the month. Although Green, 
Inc., has a semiweekly deposit schedule, it will deposit 
just once a month because it pays wages only once a 
month. The deposit, however, will be made under the 
semiweekly deposit schedule as follows: Green, Inc.'s tax liability for the May 30, 2025 (Friday), payday must be de-
posited by June 4, 2025 (Wednesday). Under the semi-
weekly deposit schedule, liabilities for wages paid on 
Wednesday through Friday must be deposited by the fol-
lowing Wednesday.
$100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule
If you accumulate $100,000 or more in taxes on any day 
during a monthly or semiweekly deposit period (see De-
posit period , earlier in this section), you must deposit the 
tax by the next business day, whether you’re a monthly or 
semiweekly schedule depositor.
For purposes of the $100,000 rule, don't continue accu-
mulating a tax liability after the end of a deposit period. 
For example, if a semiweekly schedule depositor has ac-
cumulated a liability of $95,000 on a T uesday (of a Satur-
day-through- T uesday deposit period) and accumulated a 
$10,000 liability on Wednesday, the $100,000 next -day 
deposit rule doesn't apply because the $10,000 is accu-
mulated in the next deposit period. Thus, $95,000 must be 
deposited by Friday and $10,000 must be deposited by 
the following Wednesday.
However, once you accumulate at least $100,000 in a 
deposit period, stop accumulating at the end of that day 
and begin to accumulate anew on the next day. For exam-
ple, Fir Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor. On Mon-
day, Fir Co. accumulates taxes of $110,000 and must de-
posit this amount on T uesday, the next business day. On 
T uesday, Fir Co. accumulates additional taxes of $30,000. 
Because the $30,000 isn't added to the previous 
$110,000 and is less than $100,000, Fir Co. must deposit 
the $30,000 by Friday (following the semiweekly deposit 
schedule).
If you’re a monthly schedule depositor and accu-
mulate a $100,000 tax liability on any day during 
the deposit period, you become a semiweekly 
schedule depositor on the next day and remain so for at 
least the rest of the calendar year and for the following cal-
endar year.
Example.  Elm, Inc., started its business on May 5, 
2025. On Wednesday, May 7, it paid wages for the first 
time and accumulated a tax liability of $40,000. On Friday, 
May 9, Elm, Inc., paid wages and accumulated a liability of 
$60,000, bringing its total accumulated tax liability to 
$100,000. Because this was the first year of its business, 
the tax liability for its lookback period is considered to be 
zero, and it would be a monthly schedule depositor based 
on the lookback rules. However, since Elm, Inc., accumu-
lated a $100,000 liability on May 9, it became a semi-
weekly schedule depositor on May 10. It will be a semi-
weekly schedule depositor for the remainder of 2025 and 
for 2026. Elm, Inc., is required to deposit the $100,000 by 
Monday, May 12, the next business day.

The $100,000 tax liability threshold requiring a 
next- day deposit is determined before you con-
sider any reduction of your liability for nonrefunda-
ble credits.
Accuracy of Deposits Rule
Y ou’re required to deposit 100% of your tax liability on or 
before the deposit due date. However, penalties won't be 
applied for depositing less than 100% if both of the follow-
ing conditions are met.
•Any deposit shortfall doesn't exceed the greater of 
$100 or 2% of the amount of taxes otherwise required 
to be deposited.
•The deposit shortfall is paid or deposited by the short-
fall makeup date as described next.
Makeup Date for Deposit Shortfall: 
1.Monthly schedule depositor. Deposit the shortfall 
or pay it with your return by the due date of your return 
for the return period in which the shortfall occurred. 
Y ou may pay the shortfall with your return even if the 
amount is $2,500 or more.
2.Semiweekly schedule depositor. Deposit by the 
earlier of:
a.The first Wednesday or Friday (whichever comes 
first) that falls on or after the 15th day of the month 
following the month in which the shortfall occurred, 
or
b.The due date of your return (for the return period 
of the tax liability).
For example, if a semiweekly schedule depositor has a 
deposit shortfall during July 2025, the shortfall makeup 
date is August 15, 2025 (Friday). However, if the shortfall 
occurred on the required October 1, 2025 (Wednesday), 
deposit due date for the September 26, 2025 (Friday), pay 
date, the return due date for the September 26 pay date 
(October 31, 2025) would come before the November 19, 
2025 (Wednesday), shortfall makeup date. In this case, 
the shortfall must be deposited by October 31, 2025.
How To Deposit
Y ou must deposit employment taxes, including Form 945 
taxes, by EFT . See Payment with return , earlier in this sec-
tion, for exceptions explaining when taxes may be paid 
with the tax return instead of being deposited.
Electronic deposit requirement.  Y ou must use EFT to 
make all federal tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made 
using EFTPS. If you don't want to use EFTPS, you can ar-
range for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll 
service, or other trusted third party to make electronic de-
posits on your behalf. EFTPS is a free service provided by 
the Department of the T reasury. T o get more information 
about EFTPS or to enroll in EFTPS, go to EFTPS.gov  or 
call 800 -555- 4477, 800 -244- 4829 (Spanish), or 
303-967- 5916 (toll call). T o contact EFTPS using TRS for 
TIPpeople who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech 
disability, dial 711 and then provide the TRS assistant the 
800-555- 4477 number or 800 -733- 4829. Additional infor-
mation about EFTPS is also available in Pub. 966.
When you receive your EIN.  If you’re a new em-
ployer that indicated a federal tax obligation when re-
questing an EIN, you’ll be pre -enrolled in EFTPS. Y ou’ll re-
ceive information about Express Enrollment in your 
Employer Identification Number ( EIN) Package and an ad-
ditional mailing containing your EFTPS personal identifi-
cation number (PIN) and instructions for activating your 
PIN. Call the toll -free number located in your “How to Acti-
vate Y our Enrollment” brochure to activate your enrollment 
and begin making your payroll tax deposits. If you out-
source any of your payroll and related tax duties to a 
third- party payer, such as a payroll service provider (PSP) 
or reporting agent, be sure to tell them about your EFTPS 
enrollment.
Deposit record.  For your records, an EFT T race 
Number will be provided with each successful payment. 
The number can be used as a receipt or to trace the pay-
ment.
Depositing on time.  For deposits made by EFTPS to 
be on time, you must submit the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern 
time the day before the date the deposit is due. If you use 
a third party to make a deposit on your behalf, they may 
have different cutoff times.
Same- day wire payment option.  If you fail to submit 
a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time 
the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still 
make your deposit on time by using the Federal T ax Col-
lection Service (FTCS) to make a same-day wire payment. 
T o use the same -day wire payment method, you’ll need to 
make arrangements with your financial institution ahead of 
time. Please check with your financial institution regarding 
availability, deadlines, and costs. Y our financial institution 
may charge you a fee for payments made this way. T o 
learn more about the information you’ll need to give to 
your financial institution to make a same -day wire pay-
ment, go to IRS.gov/SameDayWire .
How to claim credit for overpayments.  If you depos-
ited more than the right amount of taxes for a quarter, you 
can choose on Form 941 for that quarter (or on Form 943, 
Form 944, or Form 945 for that year) to have the overpay-
ment refunded or applied as a credit to your next return. 
Don't ask EFTPS to request a refund from the IRS for you.
Deposit Penalties
Although the deposit penalties information provi-
ded next refers specifically to Form 941, these 
rules also apply to Form 943, Form 944, and Form 
945. The penalties won't apply if the employer qualifies for 
the exceptions to the deposit requirements discussed un-
der Payment with return , earlier in this section).
Penalties may apply if you don't make required deposits 
on time or if you make deposits for less than the required 
TIP

amount. The penalties don't apply if any failure to make a 
proper and timely deposit was due to reasonable cause 
and not to willful neglect. If you receive a penalty notice, 
you can provide an explanation of why you believe reason-
able cause exists.
If you timely filed your employment tax return, the IRS 
may also waive deposit penalties if you inadvertently failed 
to deposit and it was the first quarter that you were re-
quired to deposit any employment tax, or if you inadver-
tently failed to deposit the first time after your deposit fre-
quency changed. Y ou must also meet the net worth and 
size limitations applicable to awards of administrative and 
litigation costs under section 7430; for individuals, this 
means that your net worth can't exceed $2 million, and for 
businesses, your net worth can't exceed $7 million and 
you also can't have more than 500 employees.
The IRS may also waive the deposit penalty the first 
time you're required to make a deposit if you inadvertently 
send the payment to the IRS rather than deposit it by EFT .
For amounts not properly or timely deposited, the pen-
alty rates are as follows.
Penalty Charged for...
2% Deposits made 1 to 5 days late.
5% Deposits made 6 to 15 days late.
10% Deposits made 16 or more days late, but before 10 days from 
the date of the first notice the IRS sent asking for the tax due.
10% Amounts that should have been deposited, but instead were 
paid directly to the IRS, or paid with your tax return. But see 
Payment with return , earlier in this section, for exceptions.
15% Amounts still unpaid more than 10 days after the date of the 
first notice the IRS sent asking for the tax due or the day on 
which you received notice and demand for immediate 
payment, whichever is earlier.
Late deposit penalty amounts are determined using 
calendar days, starting from the due date of the liability.
Special rule for former Form 944 filers.  If you filed 
Form 944 for the prior year and file Forms 941 for the cur-
rent year, the FTD penalty won't apply to a late deposit of 
employment taxes for January of the current year if the 
taxes are deposited in full by March 15 of the current year.
Order in which deposits are applied.  Deposits are 
generally applied to the most recent tax liability within the 
quarter. If you receive an FTD penalty notice, you may 
designate how your deposits are to be applied in order to 
minimize the amount of the penalty if you do so within 90 
days of the date of the notice. Follow the instructions on 
the penalty notice you receive. For more information on 
designating deposits, see Revenue Procedure 2001 -58. 
Y ou can find Revenue Procedure 2001 -58 on page 579 of 
Internal Revenue Bulletin 2001 -50 at IRS.gov/pub/irs-irbs/
irb01-50.pdf .
Example.  Cedar, Inc., is required to make a deposit of 
$1,000 on April 15 and $1,500 on May 15. It doesn't make 
the deposit on April 15. On May 15, Cedar, Inc., deposits 
$2,000. Under the deposits rule, which applies deposits to the most recent tax liability, $1,500 of the deposit is ap-
plied to the May 15 deposit and the remaining $500 is ap-
plied to the April deposit. Accordingly, $500 of the April 15 
liability remains undeposited. The penalty on this under-
deposit will apply as explained earlier.
Trust fund recovery penalty.  If federal income, social 
security, or Medicare taxes that must be withheld (that is, 
trust fund taxes) aren't withheld or aren't deposited or paid 
to the U.S. T reasury, the trust fund recovery penalty may 
apply. The penalty is 100% of the unpaid trust fund tax. If 
these unpaid taxes can't be immediately collected from 
the employer or business, the trust fund recovery penalty 
may be imposed on all persons who are determined by 
the IRS to be responsible for collecting, accounting for, or 
paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not do-
ing so. The trust fund recovery penalty won't apply to any 
amount of trust fund taxes an employer holds back in an-
ticipation of any credits they are entitled to.
A responsible person  can be an officer or employee 
of a corporation, a partner or employee of a partnership, 
an accountant, a volunteer director/trustee, or an em-
ployee of a sole proprietorship, or any other person or en-
tity that is responsible for collecting, accounting for, or 
paying over trust fund taxes. A responsible person may 
also include one who signs checks for the business or oth-
erwise has authority to cause the spending of business 
funds.
Willfully  means voluntarily, consciously, and intention-
ally. A responsible person acts willfully if the person knows 
the required actions of collecting, accounting for, or paying 
over trust fund taxes aren't taking place, or recklessly dis-
regards obvious and known risks to the government's right 
to receive trust fund taxes.
Separate accounting when deposits aren't made or 
withheld taxes aren't paid.  Separate accounting may 
be required if you don't pay over withheld employee social 
security, Medicare, or income taxes; deposit required 
taxes; make required payments; or file tax returns. In this 
case, you would receive written notice from the IRS requir-
ing you to deposit taxes into a special trust account for the 
U.S. Government.
Y ou may be charged with criminal penalties if you 
don't comply with the special bank deposit re-
quirements for the special trust account for the 
U.S. Government.
“Averaged” FTD penalty.  The IRS may assess an 
"averaged" FTD penalty of 2% to 10% if you’re a monthly 
schedule depositor and didn't properly complete Form 
941, line 16; Form 943, line 17; Form 944, line 13; or Form 
945, line 7, when your tax liability shown on Form 941, 
line 12; Form 943, line 13; Form 944, line 9; or Form 945, 
line 3, equaled or exceeded $2,500.
The IRS may also assess an "averaged" FTD penalty of 
2% to 10% if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor and 
your tax liability shown on Form 941, line 12; Form 943, 
CAUTION!

line 13; Form 944, line 9; or Form 945, line 3, equaled or 
exceeded $2,500 and you:
•Completed Form 941, line 16, instead of Schedule B 
(Form 941); Form 943, line 17, instead of Form 943-A; 
Form 944, line 13, instead of Form 945-A; or Form 
945, line 7, instead of Form 945-A;
•Failed to attach a properly completed Schedule B 
(Form 941); Form 943-A, or Form 945-A, as applica-
ble; or
•Improperly completed Schedule B (Form 941), Form 
943-A, or Form 945-A by, for example, entering tax de-
posits instead of tax liabilities in the numbered 
spaces.
The FTD penalty is figured by distributing your total tax 
liability shown on Form 941, line 12; Form 943, line 13; 
Form 944, line 9; or Form 945, line 3, equally throughout 
the tax period. Then we apply your deposits and pay-
ments to the averaged liabilities in the date order we re-
ceived your deposits. We figure the penalty on any tax not 
deposited, deposited late, or not deposited in the correct 
amounts. Y our deposits and payments may not be coun-
ted as timely because the actual dates of your tax liabili-
ties can't be accurately determined.
Y ou can avoid an "averaged" FTD penalty by reviewing 
your return before you file it. Follow these steps before 
submitting your Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 
945.
•If you’re a monthly schedule depositor, report your tax 
liabilities (not your deposits) in the monthly entry 
spaces on Form 941, line 16; Form 943, line 17; Form 
944, line 13; or Form 945, line 7.
•If you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor, report your 
tax liabilities (not your deposits) on Schedule B (Form 
941), Form 943-A, or Form 945-A, as applicable, on 
the lines that represent the dates your employees 
were paid.
•Verify that your total liability shown on Form 941, 
line 16, or the bottom of Schedule B (Form 941) 
equals your tax liability shown on Form 941, line 12.
•Verify that your total liability shown on Form 943, 
line 17, or Form 943-A, line M, equals your tax liability 
shown on Form 943, line 13.
•Verify that your total liability shown on Form 944, 
line 13, or Form 945-A, line M, equals your tax liability 
shown on Form 944, line 9.
•Verify that your total liability shown on Form 945, 
line 7, or Form 945-A, line M, equals your tax liability 
shown on Form 945, line 3.
•Don't show negative amounts on Form 941, line 16, or 
Schedule B (Form 941); Form 943, line 17, or Form 
943-A; Form 944, line 13, or Form 945-A; or Form 945, 
line 7, or Form 945-A.
•For prior period errors, don't adjust your tax liabilities 
reported on Form 941, line 16, or Schedule B (Form 
941); Form 943, line 17, or Form 943-A; Form 944, 
line 13, or Form 945-A; or Form 945, line 7, or Form 945-A. Instead, file an adjusted return (Form 941-X, 
943-X, 944-X, or 945-X) if you’re also adjusting your 
tax liability. If you’re only adjusting your deposits in re-
sponse to an FTD penalty notice, see the Instructions 
for Schedule B (Form 941), the Instructions for Form 
943-A (for Form 943), or the Instructions for Form 
945-A (for Forms 944 and 945).
In addition to civil penalties, you may be subject to 
criminal prosecution (brought to trial) for willfully:
•Evading tax;
•Failing to collect or truthfully account for and pay over 
tax;
•Failing to file a return, supply information, or pay any 
tax due;
•Furnishing false or fraudulent Forms W-2 to employ-
ees or failing to furnish Forms W-2;
•Committing fraud and providing false statements;
•Preparing and filing a fraudulent return; or
•Committing identity theft.
12. Filing Forms 941, Form 943, 
Form 944, or Form 945
Form 941.  If you paid wages subject to federal income 
tax withholding (including withholding on sick pay and 
supplemental unemployment benefits) or social security 
and Medicare taxes, you must file Form 941 quarterly 
even if you have no taxes to report, unless you filed a final 
return, you receive an IRS notification that you’re eligible 
to file Form 944, or the exceptions discussed later apply. 
Also, if you’re required to file Forms 941 but believe your 
employment taxes for the calendar year will be $1,000 or 
less, and you would like to file Form 944 instead of Forms 
941, you must contact the IRS during the first calendar 
quarter of the tax year to request to file Form 944. Y ou 
must receive written notice from the IRS to file Form 944 
instead of Forms 941 before you may file this form. For 
more information on requesting to file Form 944, including 
the methods and deadlines for making a request, see the 
Instructions for Form 944. Form 941 must be filed by the 
last day of the month that follows the end of the quarter. 
However, if you made timely deposits in full payment of 
your taxes for the quarter, you may file by the 10th day of 
the 2nd month that follows the end of the quarter. See Cal-
endar , earlier.
Form 943.  Y ou must file Form 943 for each calendar 
year beginning with the first year that you pay $2,500 or 
more for farmwork or you employ a farmworker who meets 
the $150 test explained under Social Security and Medi-
care T axes , in section 9. Don’t report these wages on 
Form 941, Form 944, or Form 945. File your 2024 Form

943 by January 31, 2025. However, if you made timely de-
posits in full payment of your taxes for the year, you may 
file by February 10, 2025.
Form 944.  If you receive written notification that you 
qualify for the Form 944 program, you must file Form 944 
instead of Forms 941. Y ou must file Form 944 even if you 
have no taxes to report (or you have taxes in excess of 
$1,000 to report) unless you filed a final return for the prior 
year. If you received notification to file Form 944, but pre-
fer to file Forms 941, you can request to have your filing 
requirement changed to Forms 941 during the first calen-
dar quarter of the tax year. For more information on re-
questing to file Forms 941, including the methods and 
deadlines for making a request, see the Instructions for 
Form 944. File your 2024 Form 944 by January 31, 2025. 
However, if you made timely deposits in full payment of 
your taxes for the year, you may file by February 10, 2025.
Form 945.  If you withhold or are required to withhold fed-
eral income tax (including backup withholding) from non-
payroll payments, you must file Form 945. All federal in-
come tax withholding from nonpayroll payments that is 
reported on Forms 1099 or Form W -2G must be included 
on Form 945, and not on another form such as Form 
1040- ES, Estimated T ax for Individuals. Don't report on 
Form 945 withholding that is required to be reported on 
Form 1042, Annual Withholding T ax Return for U.S. 
Source Income of Foreign Persons. Y ou don't have to file 
Form 945 for those years in which you don't have a non-
payroll tax liability. File your 2024 Form 945 by January 31, 
2025. However, if you made timely deposits in full pay-
ment of your taxes for the year, you may file by February 
10, 2025.
Exceptions.  The following exceptions apply to the filing 
requirements for Form 941 and Form 944.
•Seasonal employers who don't have to file Forms 
941 for quarters when they have no tax liability 
because they have paid no wages.  T o alert the IRS 
you won't have to file a return for 1 or more quarters 
during the year, check the “Seasonal employer” box 
on Form 941, line 18. When you fill out Form 941, be 
sure to check the box on the top of the form that corre-
sponds to the quarter reported. Generally, the IRS 
won't inquire about unfiled returns if at least one taxa-
ble return is filed each year. However, you must check 
the “Seasonal employer” box on every  Form 941 you 
file. Otherwise, the IRS will expect a return to be filed 
for each quarter.
•Household employers reporting social security 
and Medicare taxes and/or withheld income tax.  If 
you file Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944 for business 
employees, you may include taxes for household em-
ployees on your Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944. 
Otherwise, report social security and Medicare taxes 
and income tax withholding for household employees 
on Schedule H (Form 1040). See Pub. 926 for more 
information.•Agricultural employers reporting social security, 
Medicare, and withheld income taxes.  Report 
these taxes on Form 943.
Employers that pay Railroad Retirement T ax Act 
(RRTA) taxes use Form CT -1 to report employ-
ment taxes imposed by the RRTA, and Form 941 
or Form 944 to report federal income taxes withheld from 
their employees' wages and other compensation.
E-file .  The IRS e-file  program allows a taxpayer to elec-
tronically file Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, and Form 
945. For more information, go to IRS.gov/
EmploymentEfile , or call 866-255-0654.
Electronic filing by reporting agents. Reporting agents 
filing Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 for 
groups of taxpayers can file them electronically. For de-
tails, see Pub. 3112, IRS e-file  Application and Participa-
tion. For information on electronic filing, see Revenue Pro-
cedure 2007 -40, 2007 -26 I.R.B. 1488, available at 
IRS.gov/irb/2007-26_IRB#RP-2007-40 . For information on 
the different types of third -party payer arrangements, see 
section 16 .
Electronic filing by CPEOs.  With the exception of the 
first quarter (Form 941 only) for which a CPEO is certified, 
CPEOs are required to electronically file Form 941 with 
Schedule R (Form 941), or, if applicable, Form 943 with 
Schedule R (Form 943). Under certain circumstances, the 
IRS may waive the electronic filing requirement. T o re-
quest a waiver, the CPEO must file a written request using 
the IRS Online Registration System for Professional Em-
ployer Organizations at least 45 days before the due date 
of the return for which the CPEO is unable to electronically 
file. For more information on filing a waiver request elec-
tronically, go to IRS.gov/CPEO . Also see Revenue 
Procedure 2023-18 .
Penalties. For each whole or part month a return isn't 
filed when required, there is a failure -to-file (FTF) penalty 
of 5% of the unpaid tax due with that return. The maximum 
penalty is generally 25% of the tax due. Also, for each 
whole or part month the tax is paid late, there is a fail-
ure-to- pay (FTP) penalty of 0.5% per month of the amount 
of tax. For individual filers only, the FTP penalty is reduced 
from 0.5% per month to 0.25% per month if an installment 
agreement is in effect. Y ou must have filed your return on 
or before the due date of the return to qualify for the re-
duced penalty. The maximum amount of the FTP penalty 
is also 25% of the tax due. If both penalties apply in any 
month, the FTF penalty is reduced by the amount of the 
FTP penalty. The penalties won't be charged if you have 
reasonable cause for failing to file or pay. If you receive a 
penalty notice, you can provide an explanation of why you 
believe reasonable cause exists.
Note.  In addition to any penalties, interest accrues 
from the due date of the tax on any unpaid balance.

If income, social security, or Medicare taxes that must 
be withheld aren't withheld or aren't paid, you may be per-
sonally liable for the trust fund recovery penalty. See T rust 
fund recovery penalty  in section 11.
Generally, the use of a third -party payer, such as a PSP 
or reporting agent, doesn't relieve an employer of the re-
sponsibility to ensure tax returns are filed and all taxes are 
paid or deposited correctly and on time. However, see 
Certified professional employer organization (CPEO) , in 
section 16, for an exception.
Don't file more than one return per return period. 
Employers with multiple locations or divisions must file 
only one Form 941 per quarter or one Form 944 per year. 
An agricultural employer must file only one Form 943 per 
year. A payer of nonpayroll payments that withheld federal 
income tax or backup withholding must file only one Form 
945 per year. Filing more than one return may result in 
processing delays and may require correspondence be-
tween you and the IRS. For information on making adjust-
ments to previously filed returns, see section 13 .
Reminders about filing. 
•Don't report more than 1 calendar quarter on a Form 
941.
•If you need Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 
945, go to IRS.gov/Forms . Also see Ordering Em-
ployer T ax Forms, Instructions, and Publications , ear-
lier.
•Enter your name and EIN on Form 941, Form 943, 
Form 944, or Form 945. Be sure they’re exactly as they 
appeared on earlier returns.
•See the Instructions for Form 941, Instructions for 
Form 943, Instructions for Form 944, or Instructions for 
Form 945 for information on preparing the form.
Final return.  If you go out of business, you must file a fi-
nal return for the last quarter (last year for Form 943, Form 
944, or Form 945) in which wages (nonpayroll payments 
for Form 945) are paid. If you continue to pay wages or 
other compensation for periods following termination of 
your business, you must file returns for those periods. See 
the Instructions for Form 941, Instructions for Form 943, 
Instructions for Form 944, or Instructions for Form 945 for 
details on how to file a final return.
If you’re required to file a final return, you’re also re-
quired to furnish Forms W -2 to your employees and file 
Forms W -2 and W -3 with the SSA by the due date of your 
final return. Don't send an original or copy of your Form 
941, Form 943, or Form 944 to the SSA. See the General 
Instructions for Forms W -2 and W -3 for more information. 
Employers in Puerto Rico, see the Instructions for Form 
W-3 (PR) and Form W-3C (PR).
Filing late returns for previous years.  Get a copy of 
Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 (and sepa-
rate instructions) with a revision date showing the year, 
and, if applicable, quarter for which your delinquent return 
is being filed. Prior year and/or quarterly Form 941, Form 
943, Form 944, and Form 945 are available, respectively, at IRS.gov/Form941 , IRS.gov/Form943 , IRS.gov/
Form944 , and IRS.gov/Form945  (select the link for all form 
revisions under "Other items you may find useful"). Also,

Reconciling Forms W -2 and W -3 with Forms 941, 
Form 943, or Form 944.  When there are discrepancies 
between Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944 filed with the 
IRS and Forms W -2 and W -3 filed with the SSA, the IRS 
or the SSA may contact you to resolve the discrepancies.
T ake the following steps to help reduce discrepancies.
1.Report bonuses as wages and as social security and 
Medicare wages on Forms W-2 and on Forms 941, 
Form 943, or Form 944.
2.Report both social security and Medicare wages and 
taxes separately on Forms W-2 and W-3, and on 
Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944.
3.Report the employee share of social security taxes on 
Form W-2 in the box for social security tax withheld 
(box 4), not as social security wages. On Form 
499R-2/W-2PR, social security tax withheld is repor-
ted in box 21.
4.Report the employee share of Medicare taxes on 
Form W-2 in the box for Medicare tax withheld 
(box 6), not as Medicare wages. On Form 499R-2/
W-2PR, Medicare tax withheld is reported in box 23.
5.Make sure the social security wage amount for each 
employee doesn't exceed the annual social security 
wage base limit ($176,100 for 2025).
6.Don't report noncash wages that aren't subject to so-
cial security or Medicare taxes, as discussed earlier 
under Wages not paid in money  in section 5, as social 
security or Medicare wages.
7.If you used an EIN on any Forms 941, Form 943, or 
Form 944 for the year that is different from the EIN re-
ported on Form W-3, enter the other EIN on Form W-3 
in the box for “Other EIN used this year” (box h). On 
38 Publication 15 (2025)

Form W-3 (PR), “Other EIN used this year” is reported 
in box f.
8.Be sure the amounts on Form W-3 are the total of 
amounts from Forms W-2.
9.Reconcile Form W-3 with your four quarterly Forms 
941, annual Form 943, or annual Form 944 by com-
paring amounts reported for the following items.
a.Federal income tax withheld.
b.Social security and Medicare wages.
c.Social security and Medicare taxes. Generally, the 
amounts shown on Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 
944, including current year adjustments, should be 
approximately twice the amounts shown on Form 
W-3 because Forms 941, Form 943, and Form 
944 report both the employer and employee social 
security and Medicare taxes while Form W-3 re-
ports only the employee taxes.
Don't report backup withholding or withholding on non-
payroll payments, such as pensions, annuities, and gam-
bling winnings, on Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944. 
Withholding on nonpayroll payments is reported on Forms 
1099 or W -2G and must be reported on Form 945. Only 
taxes and withholding reported on Form W-2 should be re-
ported on Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944.
Amounts reported on Forms W -2, W- 3, and Forms 941, 
Form 943, or Form 944 may not match for valid reasons. 
For example, if you withheld any Additional Medicare T ax 
from your employee’s wages, the amount of Medicare tax 
that is reported on Forms 941, line 5c, column 2; Form 
943, line 5; or Form 944, line 4c, column 2, won’t be twice 
the amount of the Medicare tax withheld that is reported in 
box 6 of Form W -3 (box 13 of Form W -3 (PR)) because 
the Additional Medicare T ax is only imposed on the em-
ployee; there is no employer share of Additional Medicare 
T ax. Make sure there are valid reasons for any mismatch. 
Keep your reconciliation so you’ll have a record of why 
amounts didn't match in case there are inquiries from the 
IRS or the SSA. See the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 
941) if you need to explain any discrepancies that were 
caused by an acquisition, statutory merger, or consolida-
tion.
13. Reporting Adjustments to 
Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 
944
Current Period Adjustments
In certain cases, amounts reported as social security and 
Medicare taxes on Form 941, lines 5a–5d, column 2 (Form 
943, lines 3, 5, and 7; or Form 944, lines 4a–4d, column 
2), must be adjusted to arrive at your correct tax liability 
(for example, excluding amounts withheld by a third -party 
payer or amounts you weren't required to withhold). Cur-
rent period adjustments are reported on Form 941, lines 7–9; Form 943, line 10; or Form 944, line 6, and include 
the following types of adjustments.
Fractions-of- cents adjustment.  If there is a small dif-
ference between total taxes after adjustments and nonre-
fundable credits (Form 941, line 12; Form 943, line 13; or 
Form 944, line 9) and total deposits (Form 941, line 13; 
Form 943, line 14; or Form 944, line 10), it may have been 
caused, all or in part, by rounding to the nearest cent each 
time you figured payroll. This rounding occurs when you 
figure the amount of social security and Medicare tax to 
be withheld and deposited from each employee's wages. 
The IRS refers to rounding differences relating to em-
ployee withholding of social security and Medicare taxes 
as “fractions -of-cents” adjustments. If you pay your taxes 
with Form 941 (or Form 943 or Form 944) instead of mak-
ing deposits because your total taxes for the quarter (year 
for Form 943 or Form 944) are less than $2,500, you may 
also report a fractions-of-cents adjustment.
T o determine if you have a fractions -of-cents adjust-
ment for 2025, multiply the total wages and tips for the 
quarter subject to:
•Social security tax reported on Form 941, Form 943, 
or Form 944 by 6.2% (0.062);
•Medicare tax reported on Form 941, Form 943, or 
Form 944 by 1.45% (0.0145); and
•Additional Medicare T ax reported on Form 941, Form 
943, or Form 944 by 0.9% (0.009).
Compare these amounts (the employee share of social 
security and Medicare taxes) with the total social security 
and Medicare taxes actually withheld from employees and 
shown in your payroll records for the quarter (Form 941) or 
the year (Form 943 or Form 944). If there is a small differ-
ence, the amount, positive or negative, may be a frac-
tions-of- cents adjustment. Fractions -of-cents adjustments 
are reported on Form 941, line 7; Form 943, line 10; or 
Form 944, line 6. If the actual amount withheld is less, re-
port a negative adjustment using a minus sign (if possible; 
otherwise, use parentheses) in the entry space. If the ac-
tual amount is more, report a positive adjustment.
Adjustment of tax on third -party sick pay.  Report both 
the employer and employee share of social security and 
Medicare taxes for sick pay on Form 941, lines 5a and 5c 
(or Form 943, lines 2 and 4; or Form 944, lines 4a and 4c). 
If the aggregate wages paid for an employee by the em-
ployer and third -party payer exceed $200,000 for the cal-
endar year, report the Additional Medicare T ax on Form 
941, line 5d (Form 943, line 7; or Form 944, line 4d). Show 
as a negative adjustment on Form 941, line 8 (or Form 
943, line 10; or Form 944, line 6), the social security and 
Medicare taxes withheld on sick pay by a third -party 
payer. See section 6 of Pub. 15-A for more information.
Adjustment of tax on tips.  If, by the 10th of the month 
after the month you received an employee's report on tips, 
you don't have enough employee funds available to with-
hold the employee's share of social security and Medicare 
taxes, you no longer have to collect it. However, report the 
entire amount of these tips on Form 941, lines 5b and 5c 
Publication 15 (2025) 39

(or Form 944, lines 4b and 4c). If the aggregate wages 
and tips paid for an employee exceed $200,000 for the 
calendar year, report the Additional Medicare T ax on Form 
941, line 5d (or Form 944, line 4d). Include as a negative 
adjustment on Form 941, line 9 (or Form 944, line 6), the 
total uncollected employee share of the social security 
and Medicare taxes.
Adjustment of tax on group -term life insurance pre-
miums paid for former employees.  The employee 
share of social security and Medicare taxes for premiums 
on group -term life insurance over $50,000 for a former 
employee is paid by the former employee with their tax re-
turn and isn't collected by the employer. However, include 
all social security and Medicare taxes for such coverage 
on Form 941, lines 5a and 5c (or Form 944, lines 4a and 
4c). For Form 943, include the social security wages and 
Medicare wages on lines 2 and 4, respectively; and report 
the social security tax and Medicare tax on lines 3 and 5, 
respectively. If the amount paid for an employee for premi-
ums on group -term life insurance combined with other wa-
ges exceeds $200,000 for the calendar year, report the 
Additional Medicare T ax on Form 941, line 5d (or Form 
944, line 4d). For Form 943, include the Additional Medi-
care T ax wages on line 6 and report the Additional Medi-
care T ax on line 7. Back out the amount of the employee 
share of these taxes as a negative adjustment on Form 
941, line 9 (or Form 943, line 10; or Form 944, line 6). See 
Pub. 15 -B for more information on group -term life insur-
ance.
For the above adjustments, prepare and retain a 
brief supporting statement explaining the nature 
and amount of each. Don't attach the statement to 
Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944. See the General In-
structions for Forms W -2 and W -3 for information on how 
to report the uncollected employee share of social security 
and Medicare taxes on tips and group -term life insurance 
on Form W-2.
Example.  Cedar, Inc., filed Form 941 and was entitled 
to the following current period adjustments.
•Fractions of cents. Cedar, Inc., determined the 
amounts withheld and deposited for social security 
and Medicare taxes during the quarter were a net 
$1.44 more than the employee share of the amount 
figured on Form 941, lines 5a–5d, column 2 (social se-
curity and Medicare taxes). This difference was 
caused by adding or dropping fractions of cents when 
figuring social security and Medicare taxes for each 
wage payment. Cedar, Inc., must report a positive 
$1.44 fractions-of-cents adjustment on Form 941, 
line 7.
•Third-party sick pay. Cedar, Inc., included taxes of 
$2,000 for sick pay on Form 941, lines 5a and 5c, col-
umn 2, for social security and Medicare taxes. How-
ever, the third-party payer of the sick pay withheld and 
paid the employee share ($1,000) of these taxes. Ce-
dar, Inc., is entitled to a $1,000 sick pay adjustment 
(negative) on Form 941, line 8.
TIP•Life insurance premiums. Cedar, Inc., paid 
group-term life insurance premiums for policies in ex-
cess of $50,000 for former employees. The former 
employees must pay the employee share of the social 
security and Medicare taxes ($200) on the policies. 
However, Cedar, Inc., must include the employee 
share of these taxes with the social security and Medi-
care taxes reported on Form 941, lines 5a and 5c, col-
umn 2. Therefore, Cedar, Inc., is entitled to a negative 
$200 adjustment on Form 941, line 9.
No change to record of federal tax liability.  Don't 
make any changes to your record of federal tax liability re-
ported on Form 941, line 16, or Schedule B (Form 941) 
(for Form 943 filers, Form 943 line 17, or Form 943 -A; or 
for Form 944 filers, Form 944, line 13, or Form 945 -A) for 
current period adjustments. The amounts reported on the 
record reflect the actual amounts you withheld from em-
ployees' wages for social security and Medicare taxes. 
Because the current period adjustments make the 
amounts reported on Form 941, lines 5a–5d, column 2 (or 
Form 943, lines 3, 5, and 7; or Form 944, lines 4a–4d, col-
umn 2), equal the actual amounts you withheld (the 
amounts reported on the record), no additional changes to 
the record of federal tax liability are necessary for these 
adjustments.
Prior Period Adjustments
Forms for prior period adjustments.  Use Form 941 -X, 
Form 943- X, or Form 944 -X to make a correction after you 
discover an error on a previously filed Form 941, Form 
943, or Form 944. There are also Form 945 -X and Form 
CT-1 X to report corrections on the corresponding returns. 
Use Form 843 when requesting a refund or abatement of 
assessed interest or penalties.
See Revenue Ruling 2009 -39, 2009 -52 I.R.B. 
951, for examples of how the interest -free adjust-
ment and claim for refund rules apply in 10 differ-
ent situations. Y ou can find Revenue Ruling 2009 -39 at 
IRS.gov/irb/2009-52_IRB#RR-2009-39 .
Background.  T reasury Decision 9405 changed the proc-
ess for making interest -free adjustments to employment 
taxes reported on Form 941, Form 943, and Form 944 and 
for filing a claim for refund of employment taxes. T reasury 
Decision 9405, 2008 -32 I.R.B. 293, is available at 
IRS.gov/irb/2008-32_IRB#TD-9405 . Y ou’ll use the adjust-
ment process if you underreported employment taxes and 
are making a payment, or if you overreported employment 
taxes and will be applying the credit to the Form 941, Form 
943, or Form 944 period during which you file Form 941 -X, 
Form 943- X, or Form 944 -X. Y ou’ll use the claim process if 
you overreported employment taxes and are requesting a 
refund or abatement of the overreported amount. We use 
the terms “correct” and “corrections” to include inter-
est-free adjustments under sections 6205 and 6413, and 
claims for refund and abatement under sections 6402, 
6414, and 6404.

error on a previously filed Form 941, Form 943, or Form 
944, you must:
•Correct that error using Form 941-X, Form 943-X, or 
Form 944-X;
•File a separate Form 941-X, Form 943-X, or Form 
944-X for each Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944 
you’re correcting; and
•File Form 941-X, Form 943-X, or Form 944-X sepa-
rately. Don't file with Form 941, Form 943, or Form 
944.
Report current quarter adjustments for fractions of 
cents, third -party sick pay, tips, and group -term life insur-
ance on Form 941 using lines 7–9, on Form 943 using 
line 10, and on Form 944 using line 6. See Current Period 
Adjustments , earlier in this section.
Report the correction of underreported and overrepor-
ted amounts for the same tax period on a single Form 
941- X, Form 943 -X, or Form 944 -X unless you’re request-
ing a refund. If you’re requesting a refund and are correct-
ing both underreported and overreported amounts, file 
one Form 941 -X, Form 943 -X, or Form 944 -X correcting 
the underreported amounts only and a second Form 
941- X, Form 943 -X, or Form 944 -X correcting the overre-
ported amounts.
See the chart on the last page of Form 941 -X, Form 
943- X, or Form 944 -X for help in choosing whether to use 
the adjustment process or the claim process. See the In-
structions for Form 941- X, the Instructions for Form 943 -X, 
or the Instructions for Form 944 -X for details on how to 
make the adjustment or claim for refund or abatement.
E-file.  The IRS e-file  program allows a taxpayer to elec-
tronically file Form 941 -X, Form 943 -X, and Form 945 -X. 
For more information, go to IRS.gov/EmploymentEfile , or 
call 866-255-0654.
Income tax withholding adjustments.  In a current cal-
endar year, correct prior quarter income tax withholding 
errors by making the correction on Form 941 -X when you 
discover the error.
Y ou may make an adjustment only to correct income 
tax withholding errors discovered during the same calen-
dar year in which you paid the wages. This is because the 
employee uses the amount shown on Form W -2 or, if ap-
plicable, Form W -2c, as a credit when filing their income 
tax return (Form 1040, etc.).
Y ou can't adjust amounts reported as income tax with-
held in a prior calendar year unless it is to correct an ad-
ministrative error or section 3509 applies. An administra-
tive error occurs if the amount you entered on Form 941, 
Form 943, or Form 944 isn't the amount you actually with-
held. For example, if the total income tax actually withheld 
was incorrectly reported on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 
944 due to a mathematical or transposition error, this 
would be an administrative error. The administrative error 
adjustment corrects the amount reported on Form 941, 
Form 943, or Form 944 to agree with the amount actually 
withheld from employees and reported on their Forms 
W-2.Additional Medicare Tax withholding adjustments. 
Generally, the rules discussed earlier in this section under 
Income tax withholding adjustments  apply to Additional 
Medicare T ax withholding adjustments. That is, you may 
make an adjustment to correct Additional Medicare T ax 
withholding errors discovered during the same calendar 
year in which you paid wages. Y ou can't adjust amounts 
reported in a prior calendar year unless it is to correct an 
administrative error or section 3509 applies. If you have 
overpaid Additional Medicare T ax, you can't file a claim for 
refund for the amount of the overpayment unless the 
amount wasn't actually withheld from the employee's wa-
ges (which would be an administrative error).
If a prior year error was a nonadministrative error, you 
may correct only the wages and tips  subject to Additional 
Medicare T ax withholding.
Collecting underwithheld taxes from employees.  If 
you withheld no income, social security, or Medicare 
taxes, or less than the correct amount from an employee's 
wages, you can make it up from later pay to that em-
ployee. But you’re the one who owes the underpayment. 
Reimbursement is a matter for settlement between you 
and the employee. Underwithheld income tax and Addi-
tional Medicare T ax must be recovered from the employee 
on or before the last day of the calendar year. There are 
special rules for tax on tips (see section 6 ) and fringe ben-
efits (see section 5 ).
Refunding amounts incorrectly withheld from em-
ployees.  If you withheld more than the correct amount of 
income, social security, or Medicare taxes from wages 
paid, repay or reimburse the employee the excess. Any 
excess income tax or Additional Medicare T ax withholding 
must be repaid or reimbursed to the employee before the 
end of the calendar year in which it was withheld. Keep in 
your records the employee's written receipt showing the 
date and amount of the repayment or record of reimburse-
ment. If you didn't repay or reimburse the employee, you 
must report and pay each excess amount when you file 
Form 941 for the quarter (or Form 943 or Form 944 for the 
year) in which you withheld too much tax.
Correcting filed Forms W -2 and W -3.  When adjust-
ments are made to correct wages and social security and 
Medicare taxes because of a change in the wage totals re-
ported for a previous year, you also need to file Form W-2c 
and Form W -3c with the SSA. Up to 25 Forms W -2c per 
Form W -3c may be filed per session online, with no limit 
on the number of sessions. For more information, go to 
the SSA's Employer W -2 Filing Instructions & Information 
webpage at SSA.gov/employer .
Exceptions to interest -free corrections of employ-
ment taxes.  A correction won't be eligible for inter-
est-free treatment if:
•The failure to report relates to an issue raised in an 
IRS examination of a prior return, or
•The employer knowingly underreported its employ-
ment tax liability.

A correction won't be eligible for interest -free treatment 
after the earlier of the following.
•Receipt of an IRS notice and demand for payment af-
ter assessment.
•Receipt of an IRS notice of determination under sec-
tion 7436.
Wage Repayments
If an employee repays you for wages received in error, 
don't offset the repayments against current year wages 
unless the repayments are for amounts received in error in 
the current year.
Repayment of current year wages.  If you receive re-
payments for wages paid during a prior quarter in the cur-
rent year, report adjustments on Form 941 -X to recover in-
come tax withholding and social security and Medicare 
taxes for the repaid wages.
Repayment of prior year wages.  If you receive repay-
ments for wages paid during a prior year, report an adjust-
ment on Form 941 -X, Form 943 -X, or Form 944 -X to re-
cover the social security and Medicare taxes. Y ou can't 
make an adjustment for income tax withholding because 
the wages were income to the employee for the prior year. 
Y ou can't make an adjustment for Additional Medicare T ax 
withholding because the employee determines liability for 
Additional Medicare T ax on the employee's income tax re-
turn for the prior year.
Y ou must also file Forms W -2c and W -3c with the SSA 
to correct social security and Medicare wages and taxes. 
Don't correct wages (box 1) on Form W -2c for the amount 
paid in error. Give a copy of Form W-2c to the employee.
Employee reporting of repayment.  The wages paid 
in error in the prior year remain taxable to the employee for 
that year. This is because the employee received and had 
use of those funds during that year. The employee isn't 
entitled to file an amended return (Form 1040 -X) to re-
cover the income tax on these wages. Instead, the em-
ployee may be entitled to a deduction or credit for the re-
paid wages on their income tax return for the year of 
repayment. However, the employee should file an amen-
ded return (Form 1040 -X) to recover any Additional Medi-
care T ax paid on the wages paid in error in the prior year. If 
an employee asks about reporting their wage repayment, 
you may tell the employee to see Repayments  in Pub. 
525, T axable and Nontaxable Income, for more informa-
tion.
14. Federal Unemployment 
(FUTA) Tax
FUTA tax doesn't apply to employers in American 
Samoa, Guam, and the CNMI, but it does apply to 
employers in the USVI and Puerto Rico.
CAUTION!The Federal Unemployment T ax Act (FUTA), with state 
unemployment systems, provides for payments of unem-
ployment compensation to workers who have lost their 
jobs. Most employers pay both a federal and a state un-
employment tax. For a list of state unemployment agen-
cies, go to the U.S. Department of Labor’s website at 
oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/agencies.asp . Only the employer 
pays FUTA tax; it isn't withheld from the employee's wa-
ges. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 
940.
Services rendered to a federally recognized In-
dian tribal government (or any subdivision, sub-
sidiary, or business wholly owned by such an In-
dian tribe) are exempt from FUTA tax, subject to the tribe's 
compliance with state law. For more information, see sec-
tion 3309(d) and Pub. 4268.
Who must pay?  Use the following three tests to deter-
mine whether you must pay FUTA tax. Each test applies to 
a different category of employee, and each is independent 
of the others. If a test describes your situation, you’re sub-
ject to FUTA tax on the wages you pay to employees in 
that category during the current calendar year.
1.General test.
Y ou’re subject to FUTA tax in 2025 on the wages 
you pay employees who aren't farmworkers or house-
hold workers if:
a.Y ou paid wages of $1,500 or more in any calendar 
quarter in 2024 or 2025, or
b.Y ou had one or more employees for at least some 
part of a day in any 20 or more different weeks in 
2024 or 20 or more different weeks in 2025.
2.Household employees test.
Y ou’re subject to FUTA tax in 2025 if you paid total 
cash wages of $1,000 or more to household employ-
ees in any calendar quarter in 2024 or 2025. A house-
hold employee is an employee who performs house-
hold work in a private home, local college club, or 
local fraternity or sorority chapter.
3.Farmworkers test.
Y ou’re subject to FUTA tax in 2025 on the wages 
you pay to farmworkers if:
a.Y ou paid cash wages of $20,000 or more to farm-
workers during any calendar quarter in 2024 or 
2025, or
b.Y ou employed 10 or more farmworkers during at 
least some part of a day (whether or not at the 
same time) during any 20 or more different weeks 
in 2024 or 20 or more different weeks in 2025.
T o determine whether you meet either test above for 
farmworkers, you must count wages paid to aliens admit-
ted on a temporary basis to the United States to perform 
farmwork, also known as H-2A visa workers. However, wa-
ges paid to H -2A visa workers aren't subject to the FUTA 
tax.
Generally, farmworkers supplied by crew leaders , as 
defined earlier in section 2, are considered employees of 
TIP
42 Publication 15 (2025)

the farm operator for purposes of the FUTA tax unless (a) 
the crew leader is registered under the Migrant and Sea-
sonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act; or (b) substan-
tially all of the workers supplied by the crew leader operate 
or maintain tractors, harvesting or crop -dusting machines, 
or other machines provided by the crew leader. Therefore, 
if (a) or (b) applies, the farmworkers are generally employ-
ees of the crew leader.
Figuring FUTA tax.  For 2025, the FUTA tax rate is 6. 0%. 
The tax applies to the first $7,000 you pay to each em-
ployee as wages during the year. The $7,000 is the federal 
wage base. Y our state wage base may be different.
Generally, you can take a credit against your FUTA tax 
for amounts you paid into state unemployment funds. The 
credit may be as much as 5.4% of FUTA taxable wages. If 
you’re entitled to the maximum 5.4% credit, the FUTA tax 
rate after credit is 0.6%. Y ou’re entitled to the maximum 
credit if you paid your state unemployment taxes in full, on 
time, and on all the same wages as are subject to FUTA 
tax, and as long as the state isn't determined to be a credit 
reduction state. See the Instructions for Form 940 to de-
termine the credit.
In some states, the wages subject to state unemploy-
ment tax are the same as the wages subject to FUTA tax. 
However, certain states exclude some types of wages 
from state unemployment tax, even though they’re subject 
to FUTA tax (for example, wages paid to corporate offi-
cers, certain payments of sick pay by unions, and certain 
fringe benefits). In such a case, you may be required to 
deposit more than 0.6% FUTA tax on those wages. See 
the Instructions for Form 940 for further guidance.
In years when there are credit reduction states, 
you must include liabilities owed for credit reduc-
tion with your fourth quarter deposit. Y ou may de-
posit the anticipated extra liability throughout the year, but 
it isn't due until the due date for the deposit for the fourth 
quarter, and the associated liability should be recorded as 
being incurred in the fourth quarter. See the Instructions 
for Form 940 for more information.
Successor employer. If you acquired a business from 
an employer who was liable for FUTA tax, you may be able 
to count the wages that employer paid to the employees 
who continue to work for you when you figure the $7,000 
FUTA tax wage base. See the Instructions for Form 940.
Depositing FUTA tax.  For deposit purposes, figure 
FUTA tax quarterly. Determine your FUTA tax liability by 
multiplying the amount of taxable wages paid during the 
quarter by 0.6%. This amount may need to be adjusted, 
however, depending on your entitlement to the credit for 
state unemployment contributions. See the Instructions for 
Form 940. Stop depositing FUTA tax on an employee's 
wages when taxable wages reach $7,000 for the calendar 
year.
If your FUTA tax liability for any calendar quarter is 
$500 or less, you don't have to deposit the tax. Instead, 
you may carry it forward and add it to the liability figured in 
the next quarter to see if you must make a deposit. If your 
FUTA tax liability for any calendar quarter is over $500 
TIP(including any FUTA tax carried forward from an earlier 
quarter), you must deposit the tax by EFT . See section 11 
for more information on EFT s.
Household employees.  Y ou’re not required to de-
posit FUTA taxes for household employees unless you re-
port their wages on Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944. 
See Pub. 926 for more information.
When to deposit.  Deposit the FUTA tax by the last 
day of the first month that follows the end of the quarter. If 
the due date for making your deposit falls on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday, you may make your deposit on 
the next business day. See Legal holiday , in section 11, for 
a list of legal holidays occurring in 2025.
If your liability for the fourth quarter (plus any undepos-
ited amount from any earlier quarter) is over $500, deposit 
the entire amount by the due date of Form 940 (January 
31). If it is $500 or less, you can make a deposit, pay the 
tax with a credit or debit card, or pay the tax with your 
Form 940 by January 31. If you file Form 940 electroni-
cally, you can e-file  and use EFW to pay the balance due. 
For more information on paying your taxes with a credit or 
debit card or using EFW, go to IRS.gov/Payments .

16. Third-Party Payer 
Arrangements
An employer may outsource some or all of its federal em-
ployment tax withholding, reporting, and payment obliga-
tions. An employer who outsources payroll and related tax 
duties (that is, withholding, reporting, and paying over so-
cial security, Medicare, FUTA, and income taxes) to a 
third- party payer will generally remain responsible for 
those duties, including liability for the taxes. However, see 
Certified professional employer organization (CPEO) , later 
in this section, for an exception.
If an employer outsources some or all of its payroll re-
sponsibilities, the employer should consider the following 
information.
•The employer remains responsible for federal tax de-
posits and other federal tax payments even though the 
employer may forward the tax amounts to the 
third-party payer to make the deposits and payments. 
If the third party fails to make the deposits and pay-
ments, the IRS may assess penalties and interest on 
the employer’s account. As the employer, you may be 
liable for all taxes, penalties, and interest due. The 
employer may also be held personally liable for certain 
unpaid federal taxes.
•If the employer’s account has any issues, the IRS will 
send correspondence to the employer at the address 
of record. We strongly recommend that the employer 
maintain its address as the address of record with the 
IRS. Having correspondence sent to the address of 
the third-party payer may significantly limit the employ-
er’s ability to be informed about tax matters involving 
the employer’s business. Use Form 8822-B to update 
your business address.
•When a third party enrolls an employer in EFTPS for 
federal tax deposits, the employer will receive an In-
quiry PIN. The employer should activate and use this 
Inquiry PIN to monitor its account and ensure the third 
party is making the required tax deposits.
The following are common third -party payers who an 
employer may contract with to perform payroll and related 
tax duties.
•Payroll service provider (PSP).
•Reporting agent.
•Agent with approved Form 2678.
•Payer designated under section 3504.
•Certified professional employer organization (CPEO).
Payroll service provider (PSP). A PSP helps administer 
payroll and payroll -related tax duties on behalf of the em-
ployer. A PSP may prepare paychecks for employees, pre-
pare and file employment tax returns, prepare Forms W -2, 
and make federal tax deposits and other federal tax pay-
ments. A PSP performs these functions using the EIN of 
the employer. A PSP isn't liable as either an employer or an agent of the employer for the employer’s employment 
taxes. If an employer is using a PSP to perform its tax du-
ties, the employer remains liable for its employment tax 
obligations, including liability for employment taxes.
An employer who uses a PSP should ensure the PSP is 
using EFTPS to make federal tax deposits on behalf of the 
employer so the employer can confirm that the payments 
are being made on its behalf.
Reporting agent.  A reporting agent is a type of PSP . A 
reporting agent helps administer payroll and payroll -rela-
ted tax duties on behalf of the employer, including authori-
zation to electronically sign and file forms set forth on 
Form 8655. An employer uses Form 8655 to authorize a 
reporting agent to perform functions on behalf of the em-
ployer. A reporting agent performs these functions using 
the EIN of the employer. A reporting agent isn't liable as 
either an employer or an agent of the employer for the em-
ployer’s employment taxes. If an employer is using a re-
porting agent to perform its tax duties, the employer re-
mains liable for its employment obligations, including 
liability for employment taxes.
A reporting agent must use EFTPS to make federal tax 
deposits on behalf of an employer. The employer has ac-
cess to EFTPS to confirm federal tax deposits were made 
on its behalf.
For more information on reporting agents, see Revenue 
Procedure 2012 -32, 2012 -34 I.R.B. 267, available at 
IRS.gov/irb/2012-34_IRB#RP-2012-32 ; and Pub. 1474, 
T echnical Specifications Guide for Reporting Agent Au-
thorization and Federal T ax Depositors.
Agent with an approved Form 2678.  An agent with an 
approved Form 2678 helps administer payroll and related 
tax duties on behalf of the employer. An agent authorized 
under section 3504 may pay wages or compensation to 
some or all of the employees of an employer, prepare and 
file employment tax returns as set forth on Form 2678, 
prepare Forms W -2, and make federal tax deposits and 
other federal tax payments. An employer uses Form 2678 
to request authorization to appoint an agent to perform 
functions on behalf of the employer. An agent with an ap-
proved Form 2678 is authorized to perform these func-
tions using its own EIN. The agent files a Schedule R 
(Form 941) or, if applicable, Schedule R (Form 943) to al-
locate wages, taxes, and credits claimed to the employers 
it represents as an agent.
If an employer is using an agent with an approved Form 
2678 to perform its tax duties, the agent and the employer 
are jointly liable for the employment taxes and related tax 
duties for which the agent is authorized to perform.
Form 2678 doesn't apply to FUTA taxes reportable on 
Form 940 unless the employer is a home care service re-
cipient receiving home care services through a program 
administered by a federal, state, or local government 
agency.
For more information on an agent with an approved 
Form 2678, see Revenue Procedure 2013 -39, 2013 -52 
I.R.B. 830, available at IRS.gov/irb/
2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39 .

Payer designated under section 3504.  In certain cir-
cumstances, the IRS may designate a third -party payer to 
perform the acts of an employer. The IRS will designate a 
third- party payer on behalf of an employer if the third party 
has a service agreement with the employer. A service 
agreement is an agreement between the third -party payer 
and an employer in which the third -party payer (1) asserts 
it is the employer of individuals performing services for the 
employer; (2) pays wages to the individuals that perform 
services for the employer; and (3) assumes responsibility 
to withhold, report, and pay federal employment taxes for 
the wages it pays to the individuals who perform services 
for the employer.
A payer designated under section 3504 performs tax 
duties under the service agreement using its own EIN. If 
the IRS designates a third -party payer under section 
3504, the designated payer and the employer are jointly li-
able for the employment taxes and related tax duties for 
which the third-party payer is designated.
For more information on a payer designated under sec-
tion 3504, see Regulations section 31.3504-2.
Certified professional employer organization (CPEO). 
The Stephen Beck, Jr., ABLE Act of 2014 required the IRS 
to establish a voluntary certification program for professio-
nal employer organizations (PEOs). PEOs handle various 
payroll administration and tax reporting responsibilities for 
their business clients and are typically paid a fee based on 
payroll costs. T o become and remain certified under the 
certification program, CPEOs must meet various require-
ments described in sections 3511 and 7705 and related 
published guidance. Certification as a CPEO may affect 
the employment tax liabilities of both the CPEO and its 
customers. A CPEO is generally treated for employment 
tax purposes as the employer of any individual who per-
forms services for a customer of the CPEO and is covered 
by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between the 
CPEO and the customer (CPEO contract), but only for wa-
ges and other compensation paid to the individual by the 
CPEO. However, with respect to certain employees cov-
ered by a CPEO contract, you may also be treated as an 
employer of the employees and, consequently, may also 
be liable for federal employment taxes imposed on wages 
and other compensation paid by the CPEO to such em-
ployees.
CPEOs must complete Schedule R (Form 940), Sched-
ule R (Form 941), or Schedule R (Form 943) when filing 
an aggregate Form 940, Form 941, or Form 943, respec-
tively. CPEOs file Form 8973 to notify the IRS that they 
started or ended a service contract with a customer. T o 
become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the 
IRS Online Registration System. For more information or 
to apply to become a CPEO, go to IRS.gov/CPEO . Also 
see Revenue Procedure 2023-18 .
If both an employer and a section 3504 authorized 
agent (or CPEO or other third -party payer) paid 
wages to an employee during a quarter, both the 
employer and the section 3504 authorized agent (or 
CPEO or other third -party payer, if applicable) should file 
Form 941 reporting the wages each entity paid to the em-
ployee during the applicable quarter and issue Forms W -2 
TIPreporting the wages each entity paid to the employee dur-
ing the year.

come taxes withheld from amounts paid to U.S. Govern-
ment employees working in, as well as federal civilian and 
military pensioners residing in, American Samoa, the 
CNMI, and Guam. As noted below, these special certify-
ing requirements don't apply to federal agencies who have 
employees working in Puerto Rico or the USVl.
American Samoa
Code sections 931(a), 931(d), and 7654 provide that the 
U.S. Government is required to transfer (“cover over”) to 
the T reasury of American Samoa the federal income taxes 
withheld on amounts paid to military and civilian employ-
ees and pensioners who are residents of American Sa-
moa. The effect of these provisions is that the federal gov-
ernment transfers on at least an annual basis the federal 
income taxes withheld or collected from its employees 
and pensioners who are residents of American Samoa to 
the American Samoa T reasury. In order for the federal 
government to cover over these income taxes as required 
by law, federal agencies must certify the amount of federal 
income taxes withheld or collected from its employees 
and pensioners by following the procedures discussed un-
der Certification Procedures , later in this section.
Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands
Code section 7654 and 48 U.S.C. section 1681 (P .L. 
94-241, section 703(b)) provide that the U.S. Government

and civilian employees and pensioners who are residents 
of the CNMI. The effect of these provisions is that the fed-
eral government transfers on at least an annual basis the 
federal income taxes withheld or collected from its em-
ployees and pensioners who are residents of the CNMI to 
the CNMI T reasury. In order for the federal government to 
cover over these federal income taxes as required by law, 
federal agencies must certify the amount of federal in-
come taxes withheld or collected from its employees and 
pensioners by following the procedures discussed under 
Certification Procedures , later in this section. As dis-
cussed in the Caution  next, federal agencies aren't re-
quired to certify the amount of local CNMI taxes that are 
withheld or collected.
The U.S. T reasury Department and the CNMI Di-
vision of Revenue and T axation entered into an 
agreement under 5 U.S.C. section 5517 in De-
cember 2006. Under this agreement, all federal employers 
(including the Department of Defense) are required to 
withhold CNMI income taxes (rather than federal income 
taxes) and deposit the CNMI taxes with the CNMI T reas-
ury for employees whose regular place of federal employ-
ment is in the CNMI. Federal employers are also required 
to file quarterly and annual reports with the CNMI Division 
of Revenue and T axation. The 5517 agreement isn't appli-
cable to payments made to pensioners and compensation 
paid to members of the U.S. Armed Forces who are sta-
tioned in the CNMI but have a state of legal residence out-
side the CNMI. For more information, including details on 
completing Form W-2, go to IRS.gov/5517Agreements .
Guam
Code section 7654 and 48 U.S.C. section 1421(h) provide 
that the U.S. Government is required to cover over to the 
T reasury of Guam the federal income taxes withheld on 
amounts paid to military and civilian employees and pen-
sioners who are residents of Guam. The effect of these 
provisions is that the federal government transfers on at 
least an annual basis the federal income taxes withheld or 
collected from its employees and pensioners who are resi-
dents of Guam to the Guam T reasury. In order for the fed-
eral government to cover over these federal income taxes 
as required by law, federal agencies must certify the 
amount of federal income taxes withheld or collected from 
its employees by following the procedures discussed un-
der Certification Procedures , later in this section.
Puerto Rico
These special certifying requirements don't apply to fed-
eral agencies who have employees working in Puerto 
Rico.
The U.S. T reasury Department and Puerto Rico 
entered into an agreement under 5 U.S.C. section 
5517 in November 1988. Under this agreement, 
all federal employers (including the Department of De-
fense) are required to withhold Puerto Rico income taxes 
(rather than federal income taxes) and deposit the Puerto 
Rico taxes with the Puerto Rico T reasury for employees 
CAUTION!

U.S. Armed Forces who are stationed in Puerto Rico but

you're ultimately responsible for providing all the 
information required for the preparer to accurately 
prepare your return and for the accuracy of every item re-
ported on the return. Anyone paid to prepare tax returns 
for others should have a thorough understanding of tax 
matters. For more information on how to choose a tax pre-
parer, go to Tips for Choosing a T ax Preparer  on IRS.gov.
